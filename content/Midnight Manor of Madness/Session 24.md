>[!quote] RUINS IV
>*A friend of mine once argued that the future was a malleable thing. Even with perfect knowledge of the typical behaviour of those involved and complete understanding of the consequences of those actions, they said, you would not always be correct. I now know, completely, certainly, that they were wrong. Gods, they were so wrong.*
>\- Journal of an unknown inheritor

Antimony received another visitor that evening in the form of Ivory. While the two walked the distance to the laboratory where Antimony was keeping the sample, she told Antimony of her hallucinations of cultists, linking them to her visits to the lab. Antimony initially brushed off her concerns but Ivory pointed out that the moment the other inheritors experienced these visions, it would cause problems for her research.

Ivory suggested that Antimony might be able to study the sample in the tunnels beneath the manor but Antimony was not keen on setting foot in such a dangerous location. Nonetheless, she agreed that returning it beneath the earth was the wisest course of action. She gave Ivory a scroll to read within the depths of the manor to create matching teleportation circle to one she had drawn around the sample. Rather than wait until the inheritors' next visit, Ivory set out at once.

In a disused dead-end where her companions were unlikely to return, Ivory used the scroll. Shortly afterward, the sample was returned to the dungeon. With the assistance of a summoned demon she attempted to remove the lock on its glass tube to ensure no cultist would be able to return it to the Flesh. Of course, as soon as she had closed the path leading to the sample, she heard the ominous sound of breaking glass.

The barlgura and Ivory quickly fled aboveground, where Ivory returned the demon to the Abyss. None the worse for wear, she returned to her lodgings for the night.

The inheritors' next destination was the ruins, at Ivory's insistence. The shield guardian buried there would add a much needed increase to their firepower and the prophet who dwelt there had been allowed his dominion long enough.

Within the ruins, they moved east until they happened upon a room filled with coffins. One of them contained something that gave off an aura of magic, which Teresa immediately attempted to loot. The spirits of the dead awoke to defend the treasure and succeeded in possessing Lilith to aid them to that end. Once they had knocked Lilith unconscious, however, the ghosts themselves posed little threat to the adventurers.

To the north, they once again encountered the Collector. Much like their last meeting, the inheritors defeated him before he could do more than call forth a few spectres.

Further north, the party encountered a sphinx named Rosalie. She served as the guardian of the shield guardian and required the correct answers to three riddles to allow them to pass. With a little teamwork, the four were able to solve each riddle and reach the room where the shield guardian lay dormant.

Unexpectly, they also found a helmed horror nearby playing chess.He jovially introduced himself as Omega and invited Teresa to play a match against him. She emerged victorious and, as the party turned to leave, he lamented the loss of the only interesting company he'd had. The party suggested he come to the hamlet to meet Smith and Omega agreed.

Continuing along their initial path, the party reached a room with alphabetical tiles on the floor. A single phrase - "It is my VOW that I will give you all I have
once both doors are crossed" - was their only clue about what was required of them. Ivory eventually concluded that they would need to step on tiles with vowels and her guess proved correct, earning them a potion as a reward.

On the other side of the room, the party encountered a trio of cultists in the midst of binding a demon to their service. They dispatched the cultists and returned the demon to whence it came.

At last, they came upon the prophet's chapel. He was calmly awaiting their arrival and pleasantly told the inheritors that he would finally lift the scales from their eyes before attacking them.

The prophet himself was not a formidible man but he wielded knowledge of the future and could see exactly what weighed most heavily on their minds. The psychological battle was much more difficult thay the physical one, even with animate pews barring their way.

During the fight, the prophet revealed the barlgura's true name, much to his horror. Upon the prophet's defeat, Ivory immediately made it clear that she did not intend to use it, which deeply puzzled the demon. However, he accepted Ivory's word on the matter and returned to the Abyss without complaint.

When they returned to the hamlet, Carroll interrupted the inheritors to announce the arrival of a newcomer. Before heading off to meet her, the party took Omega to Smith's forge. The two immediately hit it off, so much so that Smith decided he would like his name to be Alpha going forward. Satisfied that they had found suitable company of their friend, they returned to their lodgings to speak with the new arrival.
