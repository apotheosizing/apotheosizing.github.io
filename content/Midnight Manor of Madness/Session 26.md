# Session 26

>[!quote] COVE IV
>*I dreamed a terrible thing last night. A wraith appeared in the sunken sanctum of the Breathless, where I had been sitting in the pews until my knees had begun to protest the hard treatment. It spoke in my dear sister Ivory's voice with hatred, promising my death on the morrow. I know not if the sun rises red today but surely my beloved sisters would never wish me ill! No, indeed. I'm sure it is just anxiety that they don't yet understand my purpose here. I'm sure once they arrive and see it for themselves, they will. They must.*
>\- Journal of Junia

The party began by travelling through the north branch of tunnels. They stopped a moment to admire some coral which turned out to actually be a pair of crabs who attacked them. A small side branch held another shambler's torch. By now, destroying the creature was no great trouble.

As the tunnel curved southward, the inheritors came across an area where water had pooled into something like a pond. A dragon was swimming inside it and, despite the party's best efforts to the contrary, Lilith struck up a conversation with him. He asked what brought this inheritors to a place such as this and they replied that they wanted to expel the evil that had taken root. The dragon asked for proof of their clqims and the party showed him the various magical items they had taken from the more powerful foes they had vanquished.

Satisfied with their honesty, the dragon Artem bestowed upon them the treasure he had been guarding - a dancing blade.

As they continued, the adventurers came across the wreckage of a ship, or more accurately the one piece of a wreck that had remained intact. A ship's figurehead, depicting a saint whom Ebony recognized as one that was worshipped in a distant land. She offered a short prayer to her for their victory.

Soon enough, the tunnels began to curve back in on themselves. The party encountered a group of kuo-toa in the midst of a dance. They reacted positively when Ivory mentioned Junia, so the inheritors engaged them in combat. The statue to which they were praying depicted the Breathless. Ivory instructed her shield guardian to destroy it, but simply beginning to crack it caused the shield guardian to rust where it made contact with the stone.

Just beyond the kuo-toa, the party came face-to-face with Junia. She was excited to see her "sisters" again and boasted of her alliance with the Siren, but unfortunately the trouble with not taking the initiative to attack - particularly when your allies are not interested in protecting you - is that you will end up dead. It took only seconds for the inheritors to kill Junia.

The Siren attempted to ensnare various members of the party with minimal luck, leading to her eventual demise as well. Lilith and Ivory dove into the strangely deep water held in the chamber and found themselves in the presence of the Breathless. The loss of Junia prompted it to extend another offer of protection from the inevitable death of the universe but both of the inheritors declined and returned to the surface.

At the eastern limit of the tunnels, the party found a woman who claimed to have been lured from the hamlet by the Siren's call. Given their many encounters with beings who sought to trick them by appearing innocent, the inheritors were not predisposed to believe her but she did not drop the act to attack them the moment their backs were turned so they agreed to escort her back to safety.

After battling both a hydra and some water elementals, the party found a rare treasure - a scroll of foresight - that appeared to be the last that the cove had to offer them. Only one more area of Decessor's lands remained unplumbed - the warrens and whatever lay there in wait for them.
