>[!quote] WEALD II
>*I keep hearing laughter in the trees, high and cold. I'm sure it's - they're? - following me. I always thought that having someone else around would be comforting in this untamed wilderness but that couldn't be further from the truth. All I can think is: what do they know that I don't?*
>\- Journal of an unknown inheritor

It was becoming routine to speak with Carroll before their departure and, as was often the case, his insights were readily available. A hag had laid claim to the second depth of the weald but he knew little aside from her interest in herbalism. As Ebony was still indisposed, Ursava accompanied the party into the wild.

Their first encounter was with a gaggle of pixies who intercepted them to insist that they needed to hop through this area on foot. Given the nature of fae, the party was skeptical of this claim but Junia obliged. Her antics amused the pixies, who offered her a cookie which the party proceeded to immediately steer her away from accepting. After a polite refusal from Ivory, the four headed to the west where they encountered a distraught-looking man who asked for the party's assistance.

He had apparently been cursed with an inability to leave the room unless money was offered to the nearby skeleton. The party was unconvinced and, after bodily removing him from the room, he relented to ask for any advice they had to improve his routine.

South, the party came upon several plots of mushrooms. By process of elimination, they discovered that the colour of the mushrooms in the patch corresponded to a certain elemental weakness. Though they didn't have access to every possible element, they were able to clear a path to the chest in the middle of the room where they found two potions and some ruby dust.

To the east, they encountered another civilian who requested that they bring her back to the hamlet. She also told them that her child needed healing if they had any to spare. Junia approached and was met with an explosion that revealed the woman's true nature. She was a hag in disguise. Aided by her sister, she attacked the party but was defeated.

The party continued north, coming across a large bed. Junia took a running leap in and fell under a spell of sleep. In dreams, she saw Carroll speaking with Virtue and Vice. The two seemed despondent and the scene shifted to a shadowy draconic figure looming over the hamlet. In the waking world, the party were ambushed by another hag who sought to consume Junia's dreams. They woke her up and fought off the fae without incurring any serious injuries.

Afterward, they examined the bed. A field of magical darkness was under it and the growling of a creature could be heard within. It bit Lilith when she placed her hand into it but it was clear that it was merely a magical effect and not a true being. At the end of the path, the party found three giant elk feasting on the carcass of a strange creature. Magic emanated from the corpse but the party were reluctant to engage the elk in combat.

The four returned to their initial point of entry and headed south. There, they found a crater filled with what seemed to be water, though it soon revealed itself to be an ooze. The creature was not hostile and the party provided it with a stick to allow it to communicate with them. It introduced itself as Hector and said it was seeking vengeance. Intrigued, the party allowed it to accompany them for the foreseeable future.

After clearing out a small group of bandits and netting an amulet of health for their trouble, the party found the familiar sight of the monument that had summoned forth the shambler and the unfamiliar sight of a gnarled tree covered in cobwebs which the party was unable to activate if it had any function.

Once again heading south, they encountered a huge chest. The keyhole was large enough to peer inside. It seemed to house a normal room, complete with furnishings, and a set of plate armour which the party took with them.

Not long after they encountered the hag and her cauldron, both of whom were determined to cook the party alive. Although both Ivory and Lilith were tossed into the cauldron over the course of the struggle, the party emerged victorious and laid claim to the hag's ladle.

Rather than retracing their steps to return to the hamlet, the party took a short rest before summoning the shambler to get their hands on the item in its possession and fighting the elk to reach the magic item contained within the unknown creature's corpse. Having satisfied their curiosity on both counts, the party made the trek back home just in time to meet Antimony for the interrogation of the cultist.
