# Session 13

>[!quote] COURTYARD II
>*When one lives a life of constant danger, it can be all too tempting to let that guard down. The charming members of the court invited myself and my companions to a dance, a riot of laughter and wine that, in truth, I barely remember. Only one instant remains indelible in my mind - our cleric had the misfortune of stepping on the toes of their dance partner. The noblewoman smiled and waved away her apologies but I have not seen them since we retired to our rooms...*
>\- Journal of an unknown inheritor

The main event was both battle and dance, with performers whirling past the inheritors and obscuring the Baron as he grandstanded. With their characteristic grim determination, the party cut through the backup dancers to reach the Baron and emerged as the victors. Although their lord had just been struck down the audience was satiated for the night and they filed out of the theatre in a buzz of pleasant chatter.

Having no further business in the Baron's court, the party followed suit and made their way back to the hamlet. Something strange streaked across the sky as they trekked back - a shooting star. It was a rare sight made all the more so by the strange unearthly glow it shone with. Ivory was able to estimate its landing site in the event they wanted to investigate the meteor, particularly as Ebony expressed interest in taking a chunk of it.

In the safety of the hamlet, the inheritors separated to take advantage of the few remaining hours of activity that the settlement maintained primarily for their benefit. Carroll intercepted Ivory once again to congratulate her on the effectiveness of the prank she had baited with the cultist amulet he had provided. He encouraged her to do so again but Ivory, a touch unnerved by his glee, insisted that it would simply be stale if repeated verbatim. Carroll reluctantly agreed, musing that he would have to dig up something else amusing as he left.

Lilith bought a small trinket from Gill to deliver to Piety as an excuse to check up on her. Two new additions to the temple's d√©cor were immediately noticeable as she stepped inside, one of which was a replacement for the stolen statuette that disappeared with Junia. The other, a depression carved into the stone filled with the symbol of the Heart's worshippers, was of far more consequence. A multitude of gashes had been scored into it and it was warm to the touch, as though vitality beat through it.

Rather than confront Piety directly, Lilith spoke to Carroll on the matter, employing magic to ensure he was truthful. Carroll took considerable offence to his gesture and informed her that he had little to offer her, being banned from entering the temple, other that the supposition that Piety had installed the relief. Remaining concerned, Lilith sought Ursava's assistance in keeping an eye on Piety, something he readily agreed to.

Meanwhile, Ivory stopped in with Victor to see how his recovery was progressing. He had spent every waking moment in the modest library of their accommodations researching resurrection magic in the hopes of finding some way of mitigating the weakness that had overcome him, with little luck. However, by all accounts, he should be back to full strength in a few days.

Elvira interrupted their discussion with the proud delivery of a mouse that she had caught. Ivory, feeling a sort of obligation to the cat, awkwardly sought out Teresa for assistance in cooking it. Teresa, to her credit, barely raised an eyebrow at this and took it to Smith's forge to roast it once she had prepared it for consumption. It served as quite a strange first meeting between the two when Smith walked into Teresa removing a rodent from his forge, but he too had the good grace not to comment much.

Unexpectedly, Hector - the ooze the party had agreed to assist in his quest for revenge - reappeared to Lilith. He communicated that Carroll was the person on whom he sought vengeance. The steward of the hamlet had done little to endear himself to the inheritors, so they were in broad agreement that they had no qualms about killing him. However, he had weathered their battle with Junia with nary a scratch, prompting some caution from Ivory.

Teresa, on the other hand, simply summoned Carroll and asked him what his greatest weaknesses were. Carroll was cheerily unhelpful, though Hector was a name he recognized as belonging to a man he once knew and seemed surprised that the party was aware of it. Having essentially declared their intentions of murder directly to their would-be victim, the conversation was ended quickly with the distinct foreboding that they would have to address the matter sooner rather than later.

The inheritors brought Hector to Dulla in the hopes that he might be able to identify some spell to reverse whatever had been done to him. He agreed to help if he was able to do so and turned the conversation to the matter of the meteor as he examined Hector. He recommended caution in investigating it, having had some experience with a small piece of a similar star in the past. It had appeared to cause the acceleration and reversal of time in a localized area around it - food would rot and broken objects reconstitute themselves in its presence. The rock had been destroyed in an experimental accident long ago, so he would be very interested in investigating the one that now lay to the east of the hamlet.

As evening gave way to true night, the party returned to their quarters to rest. Lilith continued to be plagued by dreams, this time of the party's recent murder of Macaby, though the physical deterioration they caused appeared to be halted by Piety's ministrations. Ivory also awoke in the middle of the night, with the vague impression of having a nightmare, but she was able to shake it off without much difficult and reclaim her night's rest.
