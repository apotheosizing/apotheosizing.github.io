>[!quote] WEALD IV
>*In general, there are few creatures that hunt humanoids. A village may be terrorized by a hag, for instance, but it is for schaudenfraude, rather than a 'hunt' per se. Even adventurers like myself are ambushed by opportunistic predators more often than they are hunted purposefully. Until today, I knew not the terrible fear of being prey. The pity elicited from wild look in a chasee rabbit's eye is now a matter of empathy, not sympathy, for me...*
>\- Journal of an unknown inheritor

Teresa was gone by morning, leaving behind only a short note that informed the inheritors that she had gone into the depths of the manor alone to attempt to uncover the nature of her tie to the Heart. Fortunately, Ciru was a suitable replacement and the group set out for the weald.

As was becoming commonplace, the first group of sentient beings in the weald immediately attempted to rob the party. They were able to fight them off without too much difficulty and continue westward.

A grove of unusual trees had grown along the western edge of the forest. Scowls had grown in their bark and one tree in particular was rooted in consecrated ground. Ebony concluded that it was likely a treant, though there was no way of confirming it.

After a few minutes the grove thinned and the party encountered a familiar fae. This time, he claimed that he was being robbed by a man who was to all appearances not even armed. The party was inclined to dismiss his please for help - with the exception of Ciru, who had never dealt with his deceptions before. She cast dispel magic on the man, revealing that he was a grey slaad in disguise. After they banished the slaad, the fae expressed his gratitude and immediately returned to attempting to swindle them.

In the chaos, one of the branches of a nearby tree was broken, waking the treant. Lilith attempted to reason with it but it would brook no argument and the party was forced to kill it.

Eventually, the inheritors reached a large gate, beyond which lay the bandits' stronghold. Their most fearsome weapon, a gigantic cannon, was aimed directly at the party as they arrived and they only narrowly avoided being shot the moment they entered.

Ivory made her way to the fusilliers and destroyed the magic circle that allowed another to take the place of any that the inheritors killed while Ciru disabled the cannon by making it too hot to reload. With the cannon out of play, the party needed only to defeat the bandits and destroy it.

Once the dust had settled, Ivory intercepted the soul of one of the fallen fusilliers for questioning. The cannon had been created by Decessor long ago and entrusted to the bandits to aid them in their struggle against the cult, whom Decessor had hired them to deal with. They also informed Ivory that not all of the bandits had remained in the weald. Several had broken off into a roving group that followed the Wolf.

Although the bandits had been slain, the inheritors continued to explore the remainder of the weald. They encountered a coven of hags who invited them to take something from the empty bowl that carried but the party declinee and headed north to a room filled with chairs. Spectral figures occupied all but three of them before they got to their feet and the music began. Having all been children once, the inheritors were familiar with the game and despite Ciru's destruction of several chairs throughout, Ivory emerged as the victor.

In a small clearing to the north, the party came into contact with Macaby. Unlike their encounter in the courtyard, no words were exchanged, as each party had already made up their mind about the other. However, with Dulla's words about Macaby possessing a cure for vampirism in mind, Lilith asked that the inheritors not kill him. He summoned forth an elemental to aid him but it did little good when he was trapped inside a cage of force by Ivory. After dispatching the elemental, the party began negotiations for the cure.

Macaby was unrelenting in his refusal to give them the cure, no matter what agreement or payment the party suggested. He went so far as trying to destroy it to spite them when they decided to resort to simply taking the vial from his corpse. Fortunately, Ivory was able to catch it with mage hand.

Given the fact that death had not posed much more than a setback to Macaby before, Ebony suggested that they keep him alive rather than kill him. Lilith and Ivory disagreed and quickly killed him to preempt the emerging argument.

The inheritors were unable to find anything else of note in the area and so they returned to the hamlet for the evening. Ivory took the opportunity to question Carroll about the matter of Decessor's involvement with the bandits but he was less than forthcoming.

As they had now reclaimed two areas of the estate, the inheritors turned their attention to the cove. They agreed that the time for their confrontation with Junia had come and the adventurers made their preparations to depart in the morning.
