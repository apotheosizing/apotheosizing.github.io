>[!quote] COVE II
>*The sea roils red, mindless, nightmarish, implacable; the sea is black, still, polished like the blade of a dagger. It is unpredictable and home to creatures that the land dare not nurture. One by one, my companions have all disappeared beneath its surface and I fear... I am next.*
>\- Journal of an unknown inheritor

By interrogating the cultist held in the sanitarium, Lilith learned that the object of the cult's worship - the Heart - could be reached by following the path of Decessor's awfully successful expeditions below the estate. Meanwhile Ivory sold several of the recently found magic items to buy gifts for Junia and Lilith, much to Carroll's chagrin, as one of the items sold was a potion of longevity he had hoped to obtain.

That night, Lilith and Junia were visited by nightmarish figures in their dreams. Lilith's was wholly unknown, calling upon imagery of solitude, flesh, and the depths beneath the manor; Junia became lost on the outskirts of the hamlet and encountered the hag who had trapped her in sleep.

When morning came, Piety came to visit the party before they departed for the day. She informed Lilith that she had been unable to remove the curse on the set of demon armour and it had been destroyed in the process. Though she appeared remorseful, it was clear she was not as contrite as she claimed.

Their business in the hamlet concluded, the four made for the cove. Venturing north, they found a flooded room that they traversed with the use of Ivory's ability to freeze the water. They were attacked by several corpses, one of which had a fiddle, but Ebony slew them in an instant.

To the east, the party found a room filled with various species of fish. Ivory was able to identify two of them as freshwater fish. Investigating the vicinity of the locked door on the other side of the room revealed a glyph depicting a fish submerged in water. She created two orbs of water for the fish, reviving them and causing the door to become safely passable.

Beyond the door, the party encountered a group of kuo-toa crowded around a strange statue. They attacked the worshippers, killing half of them before Junia realized that she might be able to use Deep Speech to placate them. Her hunch was correct, as the kuo-toa told her that it was the tongue of those beyond their comprehension whom they sought to speak with.

At their urging, Junia touched the statue and found her consciousness transported to the blackest deep of an underwater chasm. There, a being known as the Deep spoke to her, proclaiming the details of its rites that Junia might pass them on to the kuo-toa. She agreed and was thus granted the privileges of an emissary.

After providing the kuo-toa with the knowledge they sought, the party continue south along a winding watery tunnel until they reached a single undead playing the fiddle. He accused the party of sinking his ship, though they had done no such thing. They had begun to piece together that it had been Decessor who called down the destructive wave that felled the vessel when Ebony shot the reanimated corpse dead.

There were no further ways forward from the end of the tunnel, leading the party back to the flooded chamber to head south. Three cultists and three kuo-toa were seated at a round table in the first room they entered, evidently brokering the terms of their cooperation. Using her usual confusing tactics and her newfound status as emissary, she was able to convince the kuo-toa to return to their obelisk. The cultists of the Heart proved no obstacle.

East, the four came upon an empty chamber where three snake heads protruded from the wall. They introduced themselves as Orzo, a gossip, Orzo, a truthteller, and Irno, a skeptic of the other two's truthfulness. Rather than speak to them, the party determined it would be best to return once they had eliminated the captain and crew of the damned ship.

Another extensive tunnel stretched on to a small flooded room with a single chest at the bottom of the water. Ivory swam out to open it, only to be attacked by a pair of water weirds. The party was able to defeat the weirds and claim the treasure they guarded.

Once more, they retraced their steps to follow a different path, this one leading south. Two groups of lizardfolk, one immediately hostile and one curious, were found as they traversed the path. They were enemies of the kuo-toa, though they did not elaborate on the specifics of the conflict. Past the lair of a huge crocodile, the group found a pit filled with tentacles. Ivory approached it and was dragged in an all-consuming darkness, illuminated by only a single glowing bubble. 

It introduced itself as the Breathless and asked her what she desired most. Ivory preemptively rejected its offer, having already bound herself to the service of an otherworldly being. The Breathless claimed that forsaking such an agreement would be a great act of devotion but Ivory, though tempted, ultimately refused. For her insolence, she was returned to the party worse for the wear and... changed.
