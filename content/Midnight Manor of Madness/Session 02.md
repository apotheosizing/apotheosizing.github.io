# Session 2

As the party delved deeper, they encountered more cultists, some in gold and some in silver. Beyond them was a small shrine surrounded by demons, which the party was able to destroy without much difficulty. The statue of an angel did not appear to depict any specific figure but rather the ideals of sanctity and service. Touching it bestowed a blessing on Lilith.

The halls of the ruins twisted away from the statue and in one of these branches the party was ambushed by shadows. Even Junia's light did not hold them off and Ivory was nearly killed by their ability to sap the strength of the living before the party could defeat them. The four retreated to the shrine to recover.

Afterwards, they continued down the passage to an empty room with only a glowing green wire at its centre. Lilith found out the hard way that the wire itself posed no problem but the pressure plates surrounding it were, causing darts to shoot out from the opposite walls. Knowing now to avoid them, the party was able to navigate the room without issue.

To the south was a small room containing a confessional booth. Junia and Lilith felt bolstered by their confessions but Ebony and Ivory did not, though Ivory took some resolve from the claustrophobic judgement of the booth. To the north, the party entered a room where a stone sarcophagus engraved with the crest of the house of Decessor was guarded by a giant skeleton. For the majority of the battle, the party had difficulty landing any solid hits on the skeleton but they managed to turn the tides and emerge victorious.

Unexpectedly, the party encountered a cat nearby. It appeared to be a normal cat and Ivory took to it instantly, insisting that they bring it with them. Further south, the party reached a room with two opposing doors, each carved with flowers. A rotating statue of two figures, one with their eyes covered and the other with their arms outstretched stood in the middle of the room. Ebony was able to identify one as a tigerlily and the other as a dangerous plant and stopped the statue so that the outstretched arms reached to the tigerlily, opening both doors.

Another strange altar, like the one in the forest, occupied a room to the east and again the party chose to avoid interacting with it. The door to the west led to a long hallway with an unlit lantern, a stone arm, and two abandoned bags. Ebony investigated it for traps and found nothing, though when she moved past the hand she felt strange for a moment. Junia deduced that the hand required payment to allow passage, making it so the rest of the party could reach the end of the hall to retrieve the bags.

In the room at the hallway's end, the party interrupted a group of cultists performing a ritual with blood that bolstered their vitality immensely. The party was able to defeat them despite their greater power but the mural of blood on the wall of a heart with lines extending out from it worried the party nonetheless.

The floor's final chamber contained two statues who matched the descriptions Victor had given of his missing party members. The basilisk guarding them knocked Lilith unconscious in the struggle but Junia was able to stabilize her once the creature was dead. Petrification made Leo and Ursava much heavier, almost too much to carry even with the four adventurers working together. Instead, Ivory was able to make a path of ice for the party to slide them along back to the hamlet.

They were met by the caretaker, who told them in his too-eager way that he was glad to see them after so long an absence. The party brought the statues to Victor and suggested that he might be able to restore them to normal by taking them to Piety in the morning, which he agreed seemed wisest. Over the course of the conversation, Ivory noticed that Ebony was behaving much more abrasively than usual and invited Ebony to accompany her to the sanitorium tomorrow to meet with Dr. Antimony.

By daylight, the party went to the temple to assist Victor. With the proper payment, Piety freed Leo and Ursava from their stone prisons and Lilith returned their bags to them, short one potion that Junia had drunk. Leo was not exactly pleased but was willing to accept the promise of future repayment of the loss.

Lilith spoke to Piety about the symbol the party had seen the cultists draw and, though she denied knowing anything about it, she claimed it was dangerous. When Lilith pointed out the contradiction, Piety warned her from pursuing any further knowledge of it, for her own sake, but begrudgingly agreed to tell her of anything she learned about it. Back at their rooms, Lilith enlisted Victor's help in uncovering information about the symbol, which he was more than willing to assist in.

Meanwhile, Ebony and Ivory visited the sanitorium. Antimony noticed the change in Ebony immediately and insisted that she treat her. Ebony was skeptical but agreed, if only to get Antimony to stop bothering her about it. Her methods were exceedingly strange but they did work, removing the curse that had stricken her in the ruins below. The sisters then went to Gill's shop to purchase supplies for the cat. He remarked curiously that he had never seen a cat about town, prompting Ivory to ask the estate's caretaker where the cat might have come from.

The caretaker recalled that cats were common among visitors to Decessor's court in the old days, but was amused at the idea that the cat could have wandered to the ruins all the way from the Crimson Court. Ivory inquired further and learned that the Crimson Court were a group of nobles who were friendly with Decessor until an ill-fated party where they had all died. Their most esteemed member was a countess name Elvira.

Taking inspiration from the tale, Ivory named the cat Elvira and asked Oswald to look after the cat while she was occupied elsewhere on the estate. He was happy to do so, as he liked cats just as much as she did. The caretaker, who had drifted back behind Ivory, had outlined several different places the party could go next: the warrens (to close any portals to the Abyss cultists might have opened there), the cove (to map out the area), the weald (to clear out bandits), deeper into the ruins, or beneath the manor to follow the doomed expedition that only their ancestor had survived.

The party decided to venture first into the cove and then the weald. The caretaker provided them, through Gill, with a set of enchanted cartography tools that would be able to map the cove for them. He then escorted them to the entrance to the cove, which they descended into by repelling into the unknown depths below. When they reached the bottom, they were greeted by the distant sound of screams.
