>[!quote] WEALD I
>*For once, our expedition into the Weald was not so terrible. Or so I thought. This morning, when I awoke, I found that I could no longer recall my name. My companions do not seem to know it either. My only claim to this accursed place - gone! What will I do now? What* can *I do?*
>\- Journal of an unknown inheritor

Following the reports of banditry, the party returned to the forest that surrounded the manor. The heavy canopy of trees parted onto a clearing of a strange nature. A diminutive woman sat on a chair behind what appeared to be a free-standing door. Junia addressed her from outside the door but she did not appear to notice her. Ebony and Ivory walked through the door, startling the woman with their rudeness.

In an attempt to prove that the walls the woman insisted were present were not, Ebony walked into the space where one should be and was immediately knocked into unconsciousness. After some discussion with the woman, Ivory used her magical sight to see that there were indeed walls - they were constructed entirely of magic. The sister left abruptly after the woman asked for their names, suspecting that she was likely a fae.

Taking the upper path away from the house, the party came across a battered tent. Supplies were strewn around the vicinity but there was no indication that anyone had been in the area recently. Inside the tent were three bodies that appeared to be sound asleep aside from their lack of heads. Despite the disturbing sight, there was nothing else to be found in the area.

The party continued south, where they encountered three elderly woman who from their large cauldron filled with bobbing heads and bubbling green liquid were obviously witches. The conversation broke down quickly into a battle when Junia noted the contents of their cauldron.

Once the witches were defeated, the party stayed their course until they were stopped by the appearance of a strange man who had a number of decapitated heads in his possession. He summoned ghosts to attack the party but they vanished upon his death.

Inevitably, the party encountered cultists of the Heart. As they were a pair, they posed no threat to the party and they were able to subdue one with ease to be brought back to Antimony. Beyond the idol they were praying to, the party entered onto an expansive clearing littered with the corpses of bandits in varying states of decomposition.

An infestation of ooze had taken over the grove, much to the frustration of the dryad who lived in the area. She offered her assistance to the party in disposing of the ooze, which they managed even in light of their corrosive nature. Lilith questioned the dryad about the apparition that had attacked them and, though she didn't know much, she described him as a collector.

With the main threat to the weald removed, the party was free to explore. They did not find much of immediate interest, though they did accidentally set off a trap in pursuit of the contents of a treasure chest.

Back at the hamlet, the party's first stop was the sanitorium. Antimony did not have time to interrogate the cultist until the following day, as she was occupied with other matters, though she did appreciate the party's promptness in acquiring him.

Junia took her armful of amulets to the smith in the hopes that he might incorporate them in the place of broken scales in her armour. He found it a peculiar request but otherwise had no objection. Ivory, likewise, went into town to make some purchases. Afterward, she visited Dulla's tent to ask if he had any insight into the necromancer's powers. Dulla alluded to a magical collar that he wore that bestowed greater magical power on him and informed her that he was once the high scholar of the group.

Unfortunately, he could not provide much more than Mr. Caroll about the deaths of the other scholars, as he had not been present when it happened. This statement was contradictory to Tavrin's explanation but Ivory had no indication that he was lying.

Lilith attended her appointment with Antimony later that night. During the examination, she mentioned the leech that she had found on Virtue and asked if Antimony had any idea where it might have come from. Since it was before they had come to the sanitorium, she couldn't make a firm guess. She did offer to examine them both before their lessons the next day, which Lilith appreciated.

As had become the evening tradition, the four gathered at their accommodations to discuss their morning's destination. Tavrin provided further information on the various threats that awaited them and ultimately a decision was made to confront the necromancer where he lurked in the ruins.
