# Session 21

>[!quote] WARRENS III
>*These bowels of the earth stretch unendingly down, stale air whistling through them like wind through stripped and discarded bone. I wonder if this claustrophobia is that of the mouse devoured that has no recourse but resignation. With each nauseating intestinal twist I become more convinced that this place will be our tomb...*
>\- Journal of an unknown inheritor

As the party began their morning routine, an unsettling feeling stole through the building. There was a chill in the air and the unaccountable feeling that their surroundings had shrunk, as if to box them in. It faded after a time and drew no explicit comment from the adventurers.

Ivory left early with the intent of speaking with Antimony. On her way, she found that she was being followed by a twisted creature of flesh that she instinctively knew to be one of the transformed cultists. It disappeared moments after its discovery, leaving it unclear whether it was truly there or if it was another apparition. The more obviously corporeal person on Ivory's tail was Tavrin Carroll, who was fulfilling his duties as a busybody.

Her conversation with Antimony was brief - there was only so much Antimony could discover overnight. Still, the sample Ivory had provided had grown considerably and Antimony had learned that it changed its form in response to contact with other living beings. Par example, she tossed one of the sausages Ivory had brought for breakfast into the tank and after the sample consumed it, it took on properties of its appearance.

Once Ivory returned, the party set out for the warrens, accompanied by Victor. The cramped tunnel through which they entered the area emerged into a segmented room that coiled serpentine through a path of rutterkin. It led southwest to a room that was unnervingly empty. Piles of flesh topped with the masks of the Heart cultists suggested some manner of transformation had taken place, the details of which none of the inheritors were bold enough to imagine.

Turning around and heading east, the party found a small chamber marked only by the presence of a wooden chest. Opening it revealed that the remainder of the room was filled with blade traps that spun around the room. Fortunately, only Lilith and Teresa were in the room when the trap was sprung and they were able to escape with only minor injuries.

A path led around the trapped room to the north to a pigpen. Among the various pigs was a golden individual that Lilith sensed was some manner of celestial. As they were simply animals, appearing unaffected by the influence of the Heart, Teresa freed the creatures from captivity. All of them, including the celestial pig, took the opportunity to escape, presumably returning aboveground.

At the northern limit of the tunnels the party found a vast room filled with twisted creatures feasting on derelict carts of flesh. The opposite end of the room held a bulbous creature awash in blood and bile engaged in conversation with a woman. She acknowledged the inheritors only to tell them that they would meet their doom at her hands if they were foolish enough to approach before returning to her conversation. The party forced her hand as they approached, slaying the demonic creatures that littered the room, and she cast a spell at Lilith that made her unable to use magic or understand much of her situation beyond the identity of her fellow inheritors.

Her further attempts at magic were blocked by Ivory, who soon gained the upper hand against her. Moments before she was killed, the creature the woman was speaking to disappeared, no doubt to retreat to the further depths of the earth.

The party took some time to rest before returning to the main tunnel. To the north, another of the torches that called forth shamblers sat innocently. Given their experience with the creatures, the party decided to return to face the shambler once they had explored the rest of the area.

In a nearby room, the party found yet another cultist trapped in a circle of runes. He was in the beginning stages of the transformation that had gripped those beneath the manor. Like Charles, the inheritors offered him reprieve from his punishment, but the cultist refused to renounce the Heart. Rather than leave him, the party decided it was more prudent to kill him. He offered little in the way of resistance.

The final space connected by the tunnels held a bloody altar. Its recent use was attested to by the severed cow's head that lay beside it. Touching the altar caused a voice to ask what they offered. Ivory, seeing no indication that the altar was dedicated to the Heart, offered some of her blood and received a small blessing in return.

With nowhere further to go, the inheritors returned to the torch. In comparison to the shambler they had faced at the excavation site, the summoned creature posed little threat and they were able to claim yet another of Decessor's bizarre relics before they retraced their steps to the surface.

Upon their return to town, Victor took Lilith to the temple in the hope that Piety would be able to lift the spell that afflicted her. Fortunately, it was a relatively simple matter and Lilith was restored to her prior self. Later that evening, Lilith made temporary use of Smith's forge to craft a glass amulet bearing the symbol of the hamlet's temple. As she worked, the blacksmith watched. He admitted that he was interested in learning the art of glassblowing, which Lilith was willing to oblige, though she had little teaching experience.

Ivory made her usual visit to Jacob, emerging with several items that she intended to make gifts of to various people. Once that was taken care of, she went to the sanitorium to observe Antimony's progress. Hatherine - Antimony's assistant - told her that Antimony had left some time ago and was working in her other lab which was located on the other side of the town. Her abrasive manner raised questions from Ivory and she was told that Carroll had concluded from her visit earlier in the day that Hatherine and Ivory were courting. Ivory told Hatherine that she was free to dispell the misconception by telling Carroll that it was Antimony that she was pursuing, as that was the excuse for her frequent visits she had given to her fellow inheritors.

She followed Hatherine's directions to an old rundown building that from its appearance had not been occupied for many years. Ivory persevered, however, and found that Antimony's lab lay in the basement beneath the structure. Equipment was strewn haphazardly around the room, likely having been hastily moved to accommodate the sample. It had grown considerably in the mere hours that had passed since Ivory had seen it last.

Antimony greeted her and waved her over, musing that its current growth rate should not have been possible. She explained to Ivory that she had been searching for a means of stabilizing it and controlling its state. Finding some means to direct its hunger appeared to be the easiest method, as it had no true mind to control.

Ivory, unnerved by the increasing number of uncertain variables, told Antimony that if it became much larger, the sample would likely be enough of a threat that it would need to be destroyed or, at the very least, returned to the excavation beneath the manor. Antimony was resistant to the idea, insisting that she would be able to mitigate it through some means or another.

After her own examination, Ivory concluded that the sample's growth was likely due to feeding on magic from the runes used to contain it. If she was right, it posed a significant challenge to Antimony, who couldn't remove the runes without releasing the sample. She indicated to Ivory that she would look into more mundane methods of keeping it contained.

As though to make manifest her concerns, as Ivory made her way back to her lodging for the night, the landscape morphed around her for one brief second to a pulsating fleshy mass. Though the apparition was gone the moment she blinked, Ivory was certain that the sample would soon have to be dealt with - one way or another.
