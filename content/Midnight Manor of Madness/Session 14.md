>[!quote] RUINS III
>*Every room you've ever loved is nothing more than four walls. It's something I never thought about until I found myself traipsing through the empty chambers of this place. People laughed in these rooms, worked in them,* existed *in them. And all that is left behind are the empty spaces in which they once moved.*
>\- Journal of an unknown inheritor

With the sunrise, the inheritors rose. Ivory wanted to follow the echo of the shield guardian amulet she had picked up, thus leading them back to the ruins. Leo accompanied them (for a fee, of course) as the ruins had proved to be filled with many a locked door in the past.

The central chamber branched to the east and west. The party followed the eastern path first, finding a room filled with chests. Four of the chests were conspicuously exploded and skeletons littered the floor but that didn't stop Leo from picking the lock on one of them â€” and having it blow up in his face. However, the party escaped relatively unscathed all things considered.

To the southeast, the party reached a small chamber with a fountain. Three suits of armour had been set along the wall and moved to attack when the party approached the fountain. Once they had been defeated, they were able to examine it in earnest. Ivory determined that an aura of evocation magic emanated from it. Drinking the water proved to have a small restorative effect.

Further south, they were stopped by a locked door. Several keys could be found nearby and five numbered squares had been carved into the wall. The keys were likewise numbered. After some discussion, the inheritors were able to determine that the correct key was the one that bore a number that was a perfect square. Beyond the door lay a confession booth. Unlike the last one they had come across, however, an assailant lurked within. He was dispatched easily enough, revealing that the symbol of a heart had been carved behind the place where he sat.

At the end of this branch of the ruins, the party once again came face-to-face with cultists in the midst of a ritual. Its purpose remained unclear, as the party defeated them before it could reach its completion. The entrance to the deeper reaches of the ruins lay beneath the altar but the inheritors still had intruders to drive from the third floor.

In hopes of looping around to the initial room, the party took the door to the north. Strange scrawling on the wall lured Lilith into a trap before the revealed that they held no meaning and in the adjacent room to the west, a hunched figure asked for the party to respect the many who had died in the ruins. Teresa, being the only one who could communicate with the creature, did not, prompting the figure to attack.

After a short rest, the inheritors continued along the north path until they found themselves in a room filled with broken urns and a sarcophagus. A withered heart was found among the ceramic shards though the sarcophagus itself was empty.

Nearby was a disused study. The shelves were filled with books on monsters and those open on the desk suggested that the owner of the study had been researching the being to which the heart belonged. Curiously, a small statuette of a wagon had been placed as one of the room's few personal touches.

The final two rooms were mirrors of each other, walls lined with supplies and the majority of the space taken up by a set of chairs around a table. Its mirror was identical but for the fact that every object in the room was a mimic. The party was able to defeat the mimics and claim the bag that they guarded before deciding to return to the hamlet.

With Victor's help, Ivory was able to identify the bag as a bag of devouring. Rather than using a spell to determine this, it was Victor being pulled into the bag and almost dying a horrible death that indicated its nature to the group.

Despite worsening relationships between themselves and the caretaker of the estate, Lilith attempted to question Carroll on the statuette, which he was predictably unhelpful about. Nevertheless, the graveyard in which they met proved illuminating; among the headstones marked with the names of former inheritors - including the newly-added one for Junia - was one for Hector.

A quick visit to the ooze gained them permission to dig up the grave and Ivory was able to distract Carroll long enough for Teresa and Lilith to investigate its secrets. No corpse had been buried there but the effigy that had been placed beneath the soil was clutching a portrait of a woman in its hand.

Hector recognized the woman and informed the party that her name was Ophelia, though he could give no insight on her fate.
