>[!quote] DARKEST DUNGEON I
>*What's in a name? Individuality, say some, but that is a deceptive name for a barrier, erected to cling foolishly to the notion that we can lay claim to this holy flesh. That is why I have left my name behind, scoured like the slow erosion that brings us below. This is my dedication, whole-heartedâ€”*

Westwards, the party found evidence of just how far the Heart's influence had been insinuated in the very stone of the estate. Chunks of rock, partially consumed by animating flesh, stumbled forward to attack them. The disconcerting creatures were fortunately not particularly dangerous and several appeared to be still gestating on the nearby wall. Ivory scraped a small sample of earth and flesh into a jar for further research back at the hamlet.

In the other direction, the adventurers came across a pair of diagonal doors. The northern door gave off an aura of abjuration magic, prompting the party to head through the southern door first. The narrow pathway quickly opened up into a chamber, the only fixture of which was a statue of a heart. Disturbingly, it was warm to the touch and seemed to pulse in response to contact but it otherwise caused nothing strange to occur.

Continuing forward, they came upon a group of cultists pacing at the edges of a series of connected blue and red lines. Teresa attempted to speak to them, only to find herself in the iron grip of one of the priests. They began dragging her across the meandering pattern of lines until she was able to break free. Once the cultists were defeated, the lines rose up from the ground, revealing that they were in truth veins. They exploded not longer after, leaving the adventurers covered in blood.

Several more priests and flesh creatures accosted them as they traveled northeast. Their greater numbers pointed to increased progress of the adherents of the Heart toward their god. The party took a brief rest, during which the growths of flesh protruding from the wall shifted according to some strange rhythm.

Passing through a wall of flesh to the south, the party retrieved an indecipherable map from the cultists nearby. Though it appeared to be filled with nothing but gibberish, Ivory sensed it held magic. She held on to it in the hope that Victor might be able to make its purpose clear.

Deeper still the party reached a room occupied by an empty basin. Water drained from it at a quick rate but blood illuminated a pattern along its sides. As the four continued on the their way, Lilith heard the same voice that had gifted her with her new form tell her that she walked a righteous path, in silent answer to her greatest doubt.

The next cultist the party encountered was alone, chained down to the stone. He looked up at their approach and spoke in Primordial, saying that to have passed this way unharmed was the sign of a powerful blessing and requested that he be freed from his bond. Ivory, as the only member of the party able to speak with him, asked why he had been left here. The cultists explained that he was being punished for blaspheming against the Heart. This fact led Ivory to suggest that he might come with them and follow a different path, which he was willing to do - though he knew not how.

While Ebony worked at breaking the chains, Ivory asked for his name. He replied that he did not have one, though he may have long in his past, but he would consider choosing one for himself.

With a new companion in their midst, the group headed east. There, they found what remained of the expedition. Skeletal forms and rusted equipment - none of it worth salvaging - littered the floor and the process of excavation itself ended mere feet from where the adventurers stood...
