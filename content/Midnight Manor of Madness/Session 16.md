>[!quote] WEALD III
>*I'd never been much for the "great outdoors". I always found it harsh and unaccommodating as a child, which I suppose is an odd thing for someone who makes their living as I do. Still, it was true - until we began exploring the forest near the Decessor estate. Each time we enter, I find myself reluctant to leave the welcoming embrace of the canopy. At first, I thought it might be some sort of magical effect but none of my companions have been able to find any such thing affecting me. Perhaps I have simply found... home.*
>\- Journal of an unknown inheritor

Before departing to the weald, Ivory picked up a few sending scrolls from Jacob and offered them to Lilith. She used up two of the scrolls contacting Vice. The dragons were very excited to hear from Lilith after her absence and told her they would come back to the hamlet when they were allowed. Further inquiry revealed that they had met someone name Levi who had promised to help find her; it was easy to conclude that he was the one keeping them in the weald.

She led the party's charge into the forest, following the old paths until they reached an unfamiliar area of the weald. They followed the paths between the clearings to the north, where they encountered an old woman searching for something in the grass. Recalling the prevalence of fae in the area, Lilith was inclined to ignore her, though Ivory felt that there would be no harm in hearing her out. The woman claimed she was searching of a chest of heirlooms that had been stolen by bandits but it quickly became clear that she was indeed another fae attempting to trick them.

The party continued through the trees to the west until they came across a strange sight. A large troll sat placidly on the ground, surrounded by dead snakes. The troll was hostile when approached and filled with a venomous poison that made engaging it in combat a dangerous task but the inheritors were able to defeat the giant and continue on to the south.

Two bandits were in the process of picking over some recently-acquired spoils when the party crossed paths with them. Lilith struck up a terse conversation with them, asking if they had seen Virtue and Vice. Sensing an opportunity for profit, the bandits said that they would be willing to part with the information for the right price. Unfortunately for them, none of the members of the party were willing to entertain their bargain. With one of the bandits killed by Ivory, the other relented and told them that the fae who was keeping them hostage could be found to the south.

The party continued their walk south, stopping when they came across a peculiar sight. A man was sitting on a stump, legs crossed, writing in a notebook while surrounded by ten animated pistols that floated around him. He was unsurprised by their presence, being a former resident of the hamlet, and provided further directions to Levi's location.

After passing through another grove of trees, they reached Levi. From his casual air and the puzzle he had prepared for the inheritors it was clear that he had been awaiting their arrival. Virtue and Vice were so excited to see Lilith that they bounded through his carefully arranged basins of water, knocking two of them to the ground. He did not take this particularly well and attempted to convince the dragons that Lilith was an imposter, which Lilith responded to by pushing over another of the basins.

The ensuing fight with Levi was complicated by his skill with enchantments. He was able to ensnared everyone except Ivory with his magical charms, preventing them from harming him and essentially forcing Ivory to fight him by herself. She was able to whittle him down over time, with some indirect assistance from her allies and from the dragonets once they concluded that Lilith was who she claimed to be. After an unwise choice from Levi to fire at Virtue and Vice, Lilith was able to shake off the charm and land the final blow on the fae, returning him to the Feywild.

With the dragons in tow and Lilith no longer on the war path, the party had an opportunity to explore the remainder of the winding paths of the weald. Another group of bandits attempted to extort the party but Ivory simply provided them with money to purchase a house and an official pardon for their crimes, allowing them to return to the hamlet. The bandits figured that this was a pretty good deal and packed up their things to head back to the settlement.

The tangle of trees grew thicker as the party moved north, culminating in what had become the grave of a what appeared to be a giant. Clutched in the corpse's hand was an axe that remained in a white-knuckled grip even into death. Ivory and Ebony were able to extricate it only by cutting each finger away from the hilt - an exhausting task that they shared between them to lessen the work.

As they made their way back to the path they had come in along the party came across a group of sleeping orcs guarding a chest. Teresa was able to take the contents of the chest without awakening its guardians, earning the party a few baubles for her trouble. On their way past the elderly woman, she made one final attempt at convincing the party that the items Teresa had retrieved belonged to her. It was ultimately unsuccessful and the party was not surprised to learn that the woman was in actuality the same fae who had tried that trick on them on an earlier excursion into the weald.

Once they reached the edge of the wood, Ebony found herself unable to continue walking toward the hamlet. Ivory decided to stay with her and work on the matter of unenchanting the bone knife while Lilith, Teresa, and the dragons went to get Piety to remove whatever curse had afflicted her. As they waited, Ebony mentioned to Ivory that she had felt she had been increasingly bloodthirsty in recent days and suggested it might be wise for her to visit Antimony when they returned to the hamlet. Ivory was somewhat resistant at first but eventually agreed, if only for Ebony's peace of mind.

Luckily, Piety was able to free Ebony easily enough and the reconstituted party returned to the hamlet that evening only a little later than the normally would have.
