# Session 18

>[!quote] COVE III & DARKEST DUNGEON I
>*We descend now to shatter the fragile shell of this egg, the world. Crusted earth gives way beneath our shovels with the ease of flesh to teeth. There is something welcoming about it, as though the yolk within that yokes us bids us come deeper. I will be glad, of course, to reach my promised reward.*

It quickly became clear that Belladonna had bitten off more than he could chew. Even with Lilith acting only in a support capacity, Ebony and Teresa were able to bring the dragon within an inch of his life within mere seconds. Ivory opted to continue north to the lair of the aboleth, attempting to redirect her companion's attention to it as well. Neither were inclined to follow her, however, and they followed the retreating Belladonna southwards.

Lilith put herself between them and the dragon and, though the party did not come to blows, she did put Ebony under the effect of a hold person spell. Teresa was able to get around her and land one final attack on Belladonna, killing him. Lilith released Ebony and coldly informed them that they should be helping Ivory. The two headed north while Lilith set about searching Belladonna's hoard for a diamond.

In the aboleth's lair, Ivory was making use of her long-range magic to force the aboleth out of the water. Teresa and Ebony arrived at the strange sights of a creature built primarily for swimming slowly pulling itself across the wet stonework of the tunnel. Even short a member, the inheritors were able to defeat the aboleth while sustaining little in the way of injuries.

In the meantime, Lilith managed to locate a suitable diamond to revive Belladonna. Though the now-tarnished diamond had represented a decent chunk of his hoard, he was nonetheless grateful to Lilith for returning him to life. He hid himself beneath the silt of the chamber, knowing that the rest of the party would soon return to divide up his remaining treasures. Fortunately, he was not seen by the adventurers as they gave the room one final turn.

The party's first stop upon returning to the hamlet was to Victor to get several magic items they had found in both hoards identified. The wizard obliged, though he did take exception at primarily acting as an identification machine for the four. As compensation, Ivory made him a small purchase from Jacob's, which he took with only minor begrudgingness.

Ebony paid a visit to Smith, hoping to use his forge to construct a firearm for herself. Given the bizarre circumstances of the last use of the forge by the inheritors, he was happy to agree to a much more reasonable request. While she toiled long into the night, Lilith returned to the cove to give her share of the loot back to Belladonna. She brought Virtue and Vice with her and, despite some initial hesitation, the two dragonets enjoyed the company of an older dragon for a time.

She took the opportunity to ask if Belladonna had known their parents. He was uncertain, as he had been abandoned in his youth, but he suspected they might be descendants of the same draconic lineage as himself. Belladonna was able to offer some insight into the final threat that remained in the cove, Junia aside. He told Lilith that a siren lurked in the area's depths and suggested she prepare accordingly.

When the inheritors awoke the next morning, they found that a series of brightly-coloured tents had sprung up overnight. A woman who from her ostentatious attire could only have been the proprietor of the circus was speaking with Carroll as the four approached the town square.

She greeted the adventurers and introduced herself as the Butcher, master of ceremonies for the circus. She claimed that Decessor had enjoyed her company's shows and hoped his successors would do the same. Unlike the typical circus, the Butcher's circus invited skilled fighters to test their mettle against all variety of creatures. Most of the party expressed some interest and the Butcher gladly invited them to participate at their leisure - the circus would be in town for some time yet.

After some discussion, the party decided to finally step foot into the excavation beneath the manor that had unleashed the terrors with which they now contended. Carroll led the inheritors down into the depths of the earth, past equipment long abandoned and even the reach of light.

At the entrance to the excavation, a beholder awaited them. However, it was not initially hostile, leading the party to attempt to communicate with it. Oswald cast tongues on Ivory and she heard the beholder demanding that they reveal themselves. There didn't appear to be anything blocking its sight, which led to some confusion, but approaching the beholder made the party visible to it.

The beholder attempted to attack them as soon as it could see, but the party was able to defeat it by keeping out of its gaze as much as possible.

To the north, they happened upon a circle that emanated abjuration magic. Stepping within caused a voice to ask if they sought its protection. Lilith accepted and found her arms transformed into tentacles. Teresa, intrigued, also consented and recieved lengthened legs. The others refrained, concerned that it was some form of "gift" from the Heart.
