Ivory presented the inheritors' invitation to the doorman, allowing them access to the highest eschelon of the Crimson Court. As they proceeded inside, the party walked through a carefully cultivated garden. Oswald, charmed by the sight, leaned in to smell the flowers and got a faceful of poison for his trouble. Fortunately, Lilith was able to remove the poison before it did much more than surface level damage. Ivory had her shield guardian take a few cuttings of the flowers for future use.

Not far into the sprawling manor, the party encountered Macaby. No one was surprised by his miraculous recovery and the inheritors set about defeating him as usual. Before they could finish the deed, Macaby asked for a truce, claiming that it was foolish to waste time and resources destroying each other when a greater evil waited in this very court. The party was not inclined to accept but Lilith hoped that they might finally be able to convince him that their interests aligned. Macaby grudgingly joined the group and followed their lead through the manor.

The inheritors first headed west where, after being attacked by a pool of leeches, they encountered Vivian. He was enjoying the prestige of the court and was pleased that the adventurers were seeing him at his best at last. Lilith floated the idea that if negotiations with the countess went poorly, Vivian might be a suitable replacement. He had no qualms with the idea, though Ivory was determined it would not come to that.

The eastern wing of the house was host to minor nobles, one of whom was clearly an attache from another court. His polite interest in fellow outsiders to the court quickly grew into an intention to bite and the party dispatched him with the blessings of his rather annoyed conversation partner.

Prisoners were kept in this wing as well, presumably for easy access to blood. The party slew the guards and freed the prisoners, though the party emphasized that they should stay in their cell until they ascertained their position with the countess.

Fortunately, her chambers were found in the nearby north wing of the manor. Ivory politely introduced herself to the countess and she responded in kind. The countess was more than willing to agree to exclude the people of the hanlet from the feeding pool for a simple price - the lifeblood of one of the inheritors. This suggestion threw the group into an uproar, as they were loath to trust that the countess would keep her word if the price was paid. It was Ivory who eventually stepped up, allowing the countess to drain her of life.

The countess declared that their business was complete but Macaby was unwilling to walk away. Ivory rose as a vampire to defend the peace she had died to achieve and a fight soon broke out.

Ravenous with hunger, Ivory targeted Oswald, being the squishiest of her companions. Despite Lilith's best efforts, Ivory was successful in drinking his blood. With her rationality restored, Ivory convinced the others not to attack the countess and Macaby, knowing he stood no chance against her alone, stalked off into the night.

The journey back to the hamlet was a quiet one.

In recognition of their triumph, Carroll gave the party one (1) pair of false vampire fangs. Ivory headed directly to the sanitorium to speak with Antimony about progress on the cure. She had isolated the key ingredient as sap from a white moon but she would need some time to harvest enough to make a sufficient dose. Ivory suggested that perhaps by the time she had returned from the comet's time dilation and Antimony agreed that may be so.

She also took a closer look at Carroll with her newly acquired witchsight. His appearance continued to change between his usual appearance, something hollow, and the mutated form of the cultists beneath the manor, as though they were all simultaneously true. Ivory took the opportunity to ask Carroll about what he intended to do once they had reclaimed the estate. He claimed that a caretaker would no longer be required and so he intended to depart. Ivory invited him to stay on and while Carroll demurred, he admitted that he might be convinced otherwise.
