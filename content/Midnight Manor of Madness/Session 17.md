Ink runs in meaningless patterns across curled brown pages, what once were words now indistinguishable except by the difference in size of the splotches of purple like bruises that litter its surface.

>\- Journal of an unknown inheritor

Ebony took Ivory to the sanitorium for an examination. Antimony concluded that Ivory had indeed been afflicted with some form of madness. She would be able to restore Ivory but the procedure would take several hours.

In the meantime, Lilith visited the temple to speak with Piety once more. She explained that the restorative spell that had been cast on her previously had halted the spread of the curse but had not undone the damage already done. Piety was willing to attempt another spell that would hopefully lift the ill effects completely - greater restoration. The magic did its work, though for a moment Lilith felt that she was back in the dusk hag's lair in the weald.

Before she left, she *finally* directly inquired after how Piety's mental health had been since Junia's theft of the idol of Minerva. She admitted that it had served as a rude awakening for her but did not further elaborate, aside from encouraging Lilith to continue to hunt down the members of the cult of the Heart.

Back at the sanitorium, Teresa stopped by at the conclusion of Ivory's treatment to ask Antimony for her professional opinion on her fleshwarping abilities. The doctor had not seen anything like it before. However, she cautioned Teresa in dealing with the adherents of the Heart, as supposedly those who were closer to the god were able to do something similar. She provided Teresa with an ointment that should block any attempts the Heart might make at controlling her strange powers.

As Ivory was still exhausted from their work to pry the axe they'd found in the weald from its wielder's fingers, the party took an additional day to rest. During this time, Ivory did some research into the Sleeper Beyond the Stars. Accounts of the being were few and far between and the few available were only mildly illuminating. Still, Ivory was able to learn that it and its creations were often vulnerable to adamantine.

The next day, the inheritors returned to the cove. The flooded tunnels they found themselves in formed a strange figure-eight as they uncovered its shape. First, they headed north, encountering several of the amphibious denizens of the cove along the way.

Before long, they reached a disused door, beyond which a man was cowering near a carved relief. An eye stared down from the stone at them as the man spoke - offering to tell them what it had told him. Both Lilith and Ivory attempted to listen but the knowledge disturbed them to the point that they made to leave. The man grabbed Teresa by the shoulder to keep her from following the rest of the party, prompting Ebony to initiate combat.

The four were able to defeat him relatively easily but it was soon revealed that the axe, which had been given to Lilith, held a curse that turned its wielder into an indiscriminate attacker. Ivory quickly banished Lilith to a demiplane and the remaining party moved south in the hopes of putting some distance between themselves and Lilith.

Unfortunately, a water elemental ambushed them, forcing a confrontation while they were down a member. Nonetheless the party prevailed and when Lilith returned she had shaken out of the grip of the curse. Ebony suggested she cast remove curse, uncertain exactly what the source of the effect was until Lilith's attunement to the axe broke upon the spell taking hold.

The inheritors decided to rest in the chamber and were surprised at the appearance of an abboleth in their midst. It asked them if they served the Fathomless, which they denied. Instead, they explained that they were searching for Junia. It soon grew disinterested and departed, though not before claiming that they would meet a similar fate to hers.

As they continued south, the party saw a number of corpses. The trail of bodies led to a makeshift campsite where a sahaguin was sitting. The party was unable to communicate with them but approaching the door out of the room caused them to raise their weapon, though they backed down when it became clear that the party was armed.

Behind the door, they found the lair of a crocodile. A battle ensued, causing the sahaguin to attack as well. Neither the crocodile nor its ally were able to do much to waylay the group, however, and they continued along the tunnels.

At the eastern end of the loop, they found their path blocked by a large boulder to the north, funneling them to the south. To the party's surprise, a green dragon named Belladonna made his lair there. Lilith introduced herself as an adherent of the King-in-Platinum and thus as a potential ally, despite their conflict with Junia and her patron. In response, he requested that she kill the abboleth that lurked at the end of the tunnel. He  was willing to use his strength to move the rock.

The task was an easy one for the dragon, who allowed each member of the party to pass except for Teresa, who he was keen on eating. This, of course, did not go over well with the rest of the party, who raised their weapons against him in kind...
