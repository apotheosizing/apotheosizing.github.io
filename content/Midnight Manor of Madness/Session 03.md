# Session 3

>[!quote] COVE I
>*Back home, there is an old wives' tale that says if you put a seashell to your ear, you can hear the crash of the waves upon the rock. When we came upon a neatly-stacked piled of shells, I tried it. Whatever I heard, I pray it wasn't the ocean.*

The flooded tunnels stretched out in each cardinal direction. The party chose to go north first, following the curved path until they reached a small pool. Whatever malevolence infected the estate had turned even the fish hostile and they attacked when the party reached the edge of the pool. Being mere fish, they posed little difficulty, but Junia soon learned that a more dangerous creature lurked within. As she swam to the other side, she was grabbed by a water weird.

During the struggle, Junia was knocked unconscious, sinking to the bottom of the water. Fortunately, the party was able to destroy the weird before she suffocated and Lilith brought her back to consciousness. Two paths branched out from the other side of the pool - west and south. The party took the door to the west, finding inside a hoard of copper and a chest, all guarded by a chuul. Its poisonous tentacles ensnared both Ebony and Lilith while Junia and Ivory attacked it from a distance. The party prevailed but were worn down to the point that a quick rest was necessary.

Southward, the party found a peculiar chamber. A fish swam placidly in a glass bowl and a pile of rocks had been set in the corner. The rocks, though mundane, could be sold for a decent price. Junia immediately became attached to the fish, whom she called the Reverend, and she declared that she would come back to take it after they had mapped the area.

To the west of the central tunnel, the party found more collections of items, this time shells. Ebony dug through the haphazard pyramid to find an adamantine mace, which she gave to Junia. Continuing to the south, the party encountered another gathering of cultists who revered the Heart. Unlike their empowered brethren, these cultists were no match for the party. The party headed east to the end of this branch of tunnels. As in the other locations they explored, an altar had been erected there.

Giving in to curiosity, the party placed a torch in the sconce. Unnatural darkness extinguished all light as a creature manifested before them. It was a terrible monstrosity of the Void, unhindered by the darkness. Though it was hard-won, the party was able to defeat the creature and sent it back whence it came. When the light returned, the party found an idol on the altar. Ivory recognized it from a painting of Decessor and Ebony took possession of it, concluding that it would be useful.

The party returned to the center of the tunnels once more, choosing the south path. Almost immediately, another flooded passage blocked their way. An eel had taken up residence in the water and attempted to shock them but by keeping their distance the party remained relatively unharmed. For their perseverance, the party was rewarded with treasures. Two pearls and a pair of spell scrolls had been locked away at the end of the passage.

Only one path remained. The party ventured down the eastern tunnel, emerging upon a group of cultists of a different stripe. A number of kuo-toa were conducting some manner of ritual when the party appeared, incensing them. They were much heartier than the cultists of the Heart, in addition to wielding clerical magic. However, the party defeated them all the same and continued beyond them to the final set of chambers carved out in the tunnels. The western one contained a large coral that emitted a gentle light. It did not appear to have any magical properties but it was a welcome reminder that beauty could be found in even so dismal a place.

In the northern room, the party was met by the imposing sight of a dragon statue. Around it were two baby dragons, only days old, who were wary of the party's presence until Lilith spoke to them. Being so young, they knew very little about their origins, but the party concluded that it was likely their parent had been petrified into the statue at the centre of the room. They could not free the dragon but Lilith promised that it would be done as soon as they had the capability to do so. Until then, she would ensure that they were looked after.

With that, the party had exhausted the network of tunnels. Junia returned for the Reverend and the party, plus three, made their way back to the hamlet. Junia made a beeline for the blacksmith to sell the mace, hoping to be able to get enough gold to remove the cursed luckstone that she had attuned to and to be able to purchase it back at a later date. Smith was willing to hold onto it for a while, though he would not keep it for her indefinitely. Ebony and Ivory likewise paid a visit to Smith to purchase armour and weaponry.

After counting her gold, Junia went to the temple to speak with Piety. She was able to forcibly break the attunement between Junia and the cursed stone, freeing her of its influence at last. Lilith requested Piety's assistance with breaking another enchantment, namely the petrification on the dragon in the cove. She was willing to come along with payment for the work of casting the spell. Junia, overtaken by a desire to do something kind, pawned the luckstone to Jacob for the needed sum of money, paying on Lilith's behalf.

The map the party had made was put to quick use by Junia, Piety, and Lilith as they returned to the statue. Piety attempted to break the spell on it to no avail, meaning that either the statue was not originally a living being or that the magic that bound it was much more powerful. Regardless of the reason, Piety returned most of her payment to Junia and the three returned to the hamlet. Though the short expedition had been a failure, Junia was able to repurchase the mace from Smith with the gold she had regained.

As night began to fall, most of the party returned to their accomodations. Lilith, however, went to visit Dulla to question him about the cult of the Heart. He was more willing to discuss them than Piety, though he too warned her that knowledge of their dark practices might do more harm than good. They had some ties to the Abyss, though their god was not a demon, and congregated around the estate because something that lay beneath the manor was sacred to them.

Before the party headed to sleep, they chose their destination for the next day. They would venture into the warrens, hoping to thwart the cultists' efforts therein.
