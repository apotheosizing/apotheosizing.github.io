>[!quote] WARRENS IV
>*It cries in the night. I wish it would gibber, or laugh, or curse. It does not. I do not think my companions have heard it, with the way they still call it an abomination. Truly, I wish I had not. As it stands, I do not know if I can bring myself to face it, knowing that it feels more than monstrous things, that it... lives.*
>\- Journal of an unknown inheritor

As was becoming customary after the defeat of a looming threat, Carroll congratulated the inheritors on a job well done and gave them a conspicuously empty fishbowl to commemorate Junia's death. He also informed them that the warrens housed an escaped experiment of Decessor's, which he described as a collection of dissembled flesh.

With the whole night ahead of them, Ciru took to the task of retrofitting Ivory's shield guardian while Ivory interrogated Junia's captured soul. She knew almost nothing of interest, so Ivory released it and proceeded summarily to sell all of her remaining magic items to Jacob.

Upon the morrow, the party descended into the warrens for a final time. They were immediately greeted by a nalfeshnee eating from a cart laden with corpses, which nicely encapsulated what they were going to face in these remote reaches of the estate.

To the south, the inheritors came across a room filled with quasits in the progress of copying down various observations on the properties of pig flesh. Apparently, Decessor had set them this task many years ago but as his blood relatives, the adventurers had the right to execute his will now that he was dead. Lilith released the quasits from their contract, allowing them to return to the Abyss.

Proceeding north, they found yet a lone cultist sacrificing one of their own on an altar. The party was able to kill them before they could complete the ritual, though Ciru touched the bloody handprint on the altar in a moment of curiosity and found herself frightened enough to back away.

East, the party found a chest covered by a glass dome. It would have been easy (if painful) to break the dome but as they approached it, an equation flashed on the wall: 6+4=4. The shield guardian happened to touch the equation, causing one of the lines making up the numbers to move. Quickly, the party realized that they could move one line from the 6 to make 0, satisfying the equation and releasing the chest. Inside was a rod of the pact keeper that changed to match Ivory's aesthetic once she had attuned to it.

After that brief rest, the party continued on to a room filled with discarded corpses. Ghouls had infested the pile of rotting bodies, looking for an easy meal, but Victor and Ivory were able to kill them quickly with magic.

At the northern edge of the tunnels, the inheritors came face-to-face with the terrible creature Decessor had created. Held together by five central brains, each limb and organ in this room acted as one. The monstrosity lashed out at the inheritors at once, believing them to be Decessor.

Even with their greater number, they were unable to overcome the adventurers. Once the brains were destroyed, the rest of the creature lay inanimate, merely a pile of flesh once again.

The remainder of these tunnels had been created to mirror each other. Another waste disposal room - this one empty - was found nearby, but rather than a room with a chest, the party encountered something much stranger in the mirrored room.

Ivory's fiance, a man who was clearly more arrogant than his actual capabilities warranted, was found within. He told Ivory that he was here to take her back home and that she should give up her silly dreams of independence. Though it was evident from the first spell he cast that this man was not actually Ivory's fiance, his words were deeply unnerving to Ivory. Even once the party had defeated him, she had to take a moment to collect herself before continuing on.

One final fight with the Collector heralded the end of the inheritors' exploration of the estate's grounds. Only the infestation beneath the manor remained.

Carroll once again presented the party with a gift - a glove that caused its wearer's flesh to wither away. After thanking him for his "gift", the party took care of various errands around town.

Lilith told Antimony and Dulla that she had found a cure for her vampirism and left the remains of the potion with Antimony in the hopes she might be able to produce more. She suggested Dulla collaborate with her, which he begrudgingly agreed to. Then, she spoke to Virtue and Vice with the intention of telling them that she may again be gone for quite some time as the inheritors explored the shell of the comet. However, the dragons were so saddened by this news that Lilith changed her mind, saying that they could come with her only if they promised to be very careful.

Meanwhile, Ivory cast sending to her fiance to laud her accomplishments in the hopes that it might improve her spirits after the incident in the warrens, but his response only reminded her how much she never wanted to have to return to him again.
