>[!quote] RUINS II
>*There was a knocking at my door last night. I could discern no rhythm to it, for as soon as it fell into a pattern, the sequence changed, seemingly at random. In the morning, I dared open the door and found outside it a skeletal hand bearing a ring. It bore an image of my family crest, and inexplicably, by its wear and notches, was* my *ring...*
>\- Journal of an unknown inheritor

The mazelike walls of the ruins were a familiar sight to the party from their first excursion as they made their way north. They entered a chamber filled with chests, each of which was labelled with a phrase - 'ravenous greed', 'dire need', and 'hearts will remain empty'. After some discussion, they chose to open the third chest and found within a rod and a flask of oil.

Following the halls to the east, they encountered swarms of skeletons and cultists. Though only the cultists were capable of speech, it seemed that they were in cooperation, likely due to the necromancer's intercession. To the southeast, they encountered an ambulatory set of armour that guarded another small cache of gold and an amulet carved with a rune. By examining the rune, Ivory concluded that the amulet was responsible for controlling the armour.

Unexpectedly, the party encountered a familiar face at the eastern limit of the ruins - the Collector. He was once again eager to add their skulls to his collection, and came close to doing so with Ebony, but the party succeeded in vanquishing him again. After taking a quick rest to catch their breath, they proceeded north to an unsettling room filled with implements of torture. Each had a skeleton hanging from it, with the exception of the closed iron maiden. Lilith opened it to find a set of red potions which the party split among themselves.

West from the torture room, the party found an alchemy set that had been used but not recently to make wyvern poison. Ivory had an interest in salvaging the ingredients for her own use. Once she had done so, they continued south to find another solitary confessional. Unlike the last one, none of the four felt any the worse for wear after making use of it.

Further south, they entered a study filled with books and littered with scrolls. Curiously, many of the letters were from Decessor to the necromancer, attempting to court his favour. The party could only read one half of the conversation but it was apparent that eventually the two arranged a meeting, the outcome of which remained unknown.

Nearby, they encountered the necromancer, who wasted no time in summoning forth undead. Unfortunately for him, the party was able to inflict significant damage from range, forcing him to change his tactics to a more defensive style. In the end, however, he could not overcome the party's onslaught and was reduced to dust, leaving only his robe and collar behind.

With their objective accomplished, the party returned to the hamlet. Junia took the robe to the blacksmith for alterations while Ivory and Lilith spent time in the company of their non-humanoid companions. As the evening wore on, Antimony came to the party's quarters to speak with Lilith about a developing situation at the sanitarium.

On the walls of one room, she had isolated a sack of eggs that had grown there. There had been reports of similar occurrences throughout the hamlet and, though she had tried to eliminate them, they continued to appear after her removal. She had identified them as leech eggs but otherwise had no conclusive ideas about how they had been brought to the village. She suggested that Lilith speak to Carroll on the matter, providing her with a vial of truth serum if she had need of it.
