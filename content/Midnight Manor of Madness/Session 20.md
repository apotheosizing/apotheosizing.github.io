>*Recovered from remains of fallen stalactite. H 0.63; diam. 1.8. Pattern and extent of growth appears to be consistent with an origin point within the rock. Wet to the touch despite having been removed from network for several hours. Note comparative diam of growth tomorrow - I suspect it will have changed. Instruct workers to recover further samples ASAP.*

Following another battle with creatures of the flesh, the cultists accompanying the party was visibly agitated. Ivory prompted him for his feelings and he explained that though he knew that fighting against the beings of the Heart was unavoidable, he disliked being party to it. The party suggested he wait for them at the entrance of the area, which he agreed to. After escorting him back, the party took a quick rest before examining the final unexplored paths of the caverns.

The second of the diagonal doors to the east revealed no additional path; instead, a clay golem lurked behind it. Although they were taken aback, the party was able to deal with the golem without much difficulty.

Their last destination lay to the north, holding a creature that resembled the shamblers the party had called forth from the torches in the weald. Even it had not escaped the reach of the Heart, as exemplified by the cultist that fought at its side. Thanks to the party's hour of recovery, the four emerged from the battle battered but conscious. From the body of the cultist, they retrieved another heart amulet, this one resembling the one Ivory had in her possession.

On the trek back to the hamlet, their companion announced that he had decided on the name Charles. As was becoming customary, Virtue and Vice came to meet the inheritors as they returned to the village. They seemed wary of Charles, with Vice ending up biting him as he attempted to pet the dragon. The poison did far more damage than the bite itself, revealing to the party a potential weakness of the Heart's creations.

Lilith told Vice to apologize for hurting him - a concept which seemed completely alien to Charles, though he accepted both Vice's words and Lilith's offer of learning how to properly interact with the dragons.

While the lesson began, Ivory ushered Ebony off to the sanitorium to cure a strange delusion that she was under the effect of an invisibility potion. She passed the time until Antimony's work was done by being Jacob's only customer in town. After confirming that Ebony's ailment was cured, she presented Antimony with the sample she had taken from the tunnels in the hopes she could glean something useful from it. Ivory recommended that she collaborate with Dulla but Antimony waved her off, becoming increasingly fixated on the sample.

Worried about Antimony being exposed to some ill-effects in her research, Ivory decided to make a nightly visit to the sanitorium part of her routine. She stopped by Gil's General and Specific Goods to buy chocolate - quite a rarity for the area, though Gil was easily able to obtain it by means of interplanar trade routes.

Though the prospect made her uneasy, Lilith stopped by the temple to seek Piety's help in removing the blessing the Heart had placed on her. She also took the opportunity to inquire about the amulet they had retrieved. Piety explained that it was a common gift for new initiates, as it mitigated the influence of the Heart until they were ready to fully embrace it. On that note, Piety presented Lilith with a scroll to be used at the opportune moment, which Lilith accepted with a promise to see Piety's plan carried out.

The party reconvened at Dulla's tent to check on Hector. He had taken on a humanoid shape, though he remained an ooze for the time being. The party's unexpected visit interrupted a meeting with a colleague of Dulla's, a flaming skull who was disinterested in introducing himself to the party. Once their business was concluded, Dulla told the party that the two of them were working on an archaeological project, though he steered the conversation elsewhere before the party could ask about the particulars.

They emerged from the tent to a small commotion in the square. Charles and the dragons were enjoying some recreational flight, which ordinarily would have been nothing to remark upon, but the wings of flesh Charles had sprouted drew concern from the populace until Ivory put them at ease. Nevertheless, the incident served to highlight that while Charles may have renounced the Heart, It had not severed ties with him.
