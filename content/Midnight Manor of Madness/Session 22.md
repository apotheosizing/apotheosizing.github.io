> [!quote] THE BUTCHER'S CIRCUS I

Come one, come all to THE BUTCHER'S CIRCUS! Allow yourself to be DAZZLED and AMAZED by contenders from the high snowy peaks of the north to the lowest depths of the Nine Hells! ONE NIGHT ONLY!

AND FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, see the BATTLE PROWESS of THE INHERITORS before your very eyes!

Their opponents are:

THE JOLLY ROGER. Five sailors come from across the sea to give the LANDLUBBERS what for! They've weathered storms that wouLd threaten to engulf this very hamlet and fought CREATURES OF THE DEEP with naught more than their fists!

THE KNIGHTS OF THE RAINBOW. Brothers-in-arms and the heroes of many a HOPELESS WAR, these six soldiers are masters of the battlefield. Come witness the DEVASTATION of their two-pronged pincer strategy!

PLANAR PANIC. From across the FOUR prime elemental planes, we bring you contenders forged in the flame (and water and air and earth) of UNCEASING ELEMENTAL CONFLICT. In prefect balance, these elementals will force those who oppose them to be versatile! Themed fighters beware!

BUBBLES THE DRAGON. Hailing from the FETID SWQMPS of the west, don't let this fearsome black dragon's name fool you! Once known as the RUIN OF KINGDOMS, Bubbles has been the DOOM OF LEGIONS of proud knights and foolish graverobbers. Will our INHERITORS be next!?

THE BLIZZARD. This octet of white dragons may be young but they sure can pack a WALLOP! The FROZEN REMAINS of their last opponents can be viewed after the round for a mere FIVE SILVER!

AND FINALLY, THE STAR OF THE SHOW (and tonight's generous sponsor) THE TERRIBLE PITCHFORK! A horned devil from the deepest reaches of HELL, a veteran of the BLOOD WAR, and an all-around swell guy! AUTOGRAPHS CAN BE PURCHASED AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE EVENT!

With only THREE RESTS at their disposal, will our INHERITORS emerge victorious? 2 GOLD ADMISSION, CONCESSIONS SOLD SEPARATELY.
