Rather than the peaceful sight of the hamlet that they had become accustomed to, the inheritors returned to the fresh aftermath of a battle. The cobblestones were wet, with rivulets of water running down from the well at the centre of town. Boudicca, who was still cleaning her bardiche, informed the party that groups of kuo-toa had climbed out of the well to attack. Carroll observed that they appeared to be attempting to make their way toward the hamlet.

As they approached the well, a wave of kuo-toa sprung forth, led by a priest. Junia invoked her status as emissary of the Deep to open negotiations with the kuo-toa but they made it clear that they had no intention of backing down. She would have to choose - between her family and the god who she had brought down on their heads. Junia made her choice and stepped across the lines of battle to join the kuo-toa.

The ensuing battle was brief but deadly. Before descending into the well, Junia called forth a ball of boiling steam that engulfed the party, killing Victor outright. The three still standing were able to take out the kuo-toa if only barely. When the fight was over, they headed to Dulla's tent with Victor's body in tow in the hopes of resurrecting him.

While Dulla made his preliminary preparations for the ritual, he took in the news of what had transpired. He paused when the party mentioned the Fathomless gods, as the hamlet should have been protected from their incursions by a statuette in the temple.

Hearing this, Lilith went to the temple to speak with Piety. She found her hiding in the cloister, looking significantly more frazzled that Lilith had ever seen her. She insisted that the night's events were her fault, explaining that when she noticed the statue was missing, she found a blue cultists' amulet at the altar.

Piety had concluded that the cultists had stolen in revenge for her defecting from the cult. Lilith proposed that they had taken the statue as part of their alliance with the kuo-toa and did her best to comfort Piety, as she was not truly at fault. With the revelation of how dangerous the cult had grown, Piety told Lilith that she was no longer opposed to investigating them and would assist Lilith as much as she could. They must be destroyed before they were able to do further damage to innocent people.

On her way back to the quarters, she encountered a strange hunter named Macaby. He spoke little and dismissed the notion of working with the inheritors, though he indicated he intended to cleanse the lands of monsters.

Exhausted, the party limped back to their rooms, where they found that a new arrival had come through the old road. She introduced herself as Teresa, a scion of a house of distant relation to the Decessor estate who had been disowned due to the condition she had contracted. In the wake of the loss of Junia, the party was glad of her help.

Just before they headed to their nightly rests, Victor stumbled through the door, weakened from the effects resurrection ritual but alive. As was becoming routine, Lilith dreamed darkly. She dreamt of the succubus' deception in the warrens, except she was indeed innocent. Her allies, disgusted with her actions, turned away and when she went to follow, she found that she could not leave the circle that had trapped the fiends in the depths.

In the morning, after some cajoling from the party, Lilith spoke with Piety once again and asked for her assistance with the matter. She attempted to break the curse, assuming it was one, but it had no obviously visible effects.

Once they were all prepared, the inheritors returned to the neighbouring lands of the Crimson Court. Ivory presented their invitation to the two who guarded the deeper reaches of the court, gaining entry among those under the Baron's purview.

To the north, two ladies in finery were dining. Ivory conversed with them easily and learned that the Baron was holding a show that would start soon. His performances were always to die for and they entreated the party to attend.

As they followed the directions they had received to the stage, the party encountered Macaby, resting at a makeshift campfire. He quickly took Ivory for a vampire and attacked the party, meeting his end in so doing.

Without any detours, the party was able to reach the showroom in short order, coming face-to-face with the Baron. Ivory explained to him that she sought a renewed alliance with the court in the hopes of putting all that unfortunate business with Decessor behind them all. The Baron was interested in her proposal and provided her with an invitation to the Viscount's court, where they could recommend her to the Countess.

However, the audience demanded a show, so the party was swept into his performance...
