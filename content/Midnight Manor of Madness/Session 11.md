The party's first encounter was with a group of vargouilles and a siren who had formed a country band. Ever the quickdraw, Ebony initiated hostilities before they could get through a complete performance. Following the path to the south, the four encountered a table lavishly ladden with a feast. Three fleshy monstrosities were consumed in enjoying the food, until the party attacked.

Further south, the party reached a room filled to ankle height with some unidentifiable liquid, where shards of bone littered the ground. Wisely, they decided not to bother with it and diverted to the northeast. A single shaft, like that of a well, occupied the room. Junia peered over the side to get a look at its contents only to discover that it was piled high with dismembered corpses.

Nearby the party found themselves in a ritual chamber, as the tall stone obelisk with chains dangling from it attested. Junia approached it in the hopes of understanding its purpose only to be overcome with an urge to spill someone's blood on the altar. Selecting Victor as her target, she lunged toward him, though fortunately he was able to dodge out of harm's way. Peculiarly, this ended Junia's impulse and the party was able to continue unhindered.

Continuing to the utmost south of the area, the party fought their way through a series of demonic binding circles that trapped various types of fiends. The most formidable of these individuals was a succubus who attempted to manipulate the party into thinking she was an injured victim. Though her ploy failed, she was briefly able to charm Lilith and cause significant injury to the party in the process.

Once all the trapped demons were returned to the Abyss, the party returned to the entrance to recuperate. After an hour of rest, they explored the alternate paths to the east of the area. A winding hall took the party to a single treasure chest which Junia immediately attempted to open. Her hand went through the illusion, activating a poison gas trap that the party had to escape from.

Having no remaining options, they entered a room that was occupied by a towering mound of excrement. None of the party were inclined to handle it directly, opting instead to play cards while Victor's skeletal followers excavated a path through it.

There, they passed through a torture chamber that appeared to have been used disturbingly recently to a small chamber where two basins and two jars were laid out. One basin was filled with murky water and the other was empty, while one jar contained clear water and its pair contained nothing. It took some trial and error, but they eventually deduced that both basins had to be filled with clear water split between the two jugs. The clean, sparkling water was refreshing but otherwise unremarkable.

Another fight with the Collector led into the lair of the Swine King who had laid claim to the warrens. Both he and the small, seemingly normal pig atop his head engaged the weakened party only to be defeated. His fall marked the accomplishment of the retaking of the second depth of all the accessible areas Caroll had indicated to the inheritors.
