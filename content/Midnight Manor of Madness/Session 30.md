>[!quote] COMET III
>*I've been having trouble sleeping these past few nights. Even while Mildred is soundly asleep, I find myself walking down to the fields and wandering them aimlessly, eyes wide open despite the lateness of the hour. Truthfully, I'm not sure why. My days are hard and my body aches for rest but my mind pays them no heed. Maybe I should speak with the priest tomorrow, if I can spare the time. I've been thinking, or dreaming, on these walks of something... dark.*
>\- Journal of a miller

Straight away, Luitpold took the gift basket to Antimony to have it checked for poison. She confirmed that the wine was safe and then inquired about who exactly he was. While they got acquainted, Ivory purchased a bottle of wine with the intention of spiking it with poison - not enough to kill, but enough to send a clear message about what she thought of the newest inheritor.

Just as he did with the last, Luitpold took the bottle to Antimony, who was surprised to find that it was indeed poisoned. Antimony insisted that there must have been a mixup, as Ivory would never do such a thing, but Luitpold remained unconvinced.

Lilith spoke to Virtue and Vice about their preference regarding the final venture into the space beyond the comet. After their harrowing experience, both dragons said that they wanted to stay in the hamlet. Lilith provided them with two scrolls of sending to use if they needed to speak with her while she was away.

With their business in the town taken care of, the party returned to the farmer's fields for what they felt would be the final time. When the dirt walls fell in the strange dimension of the Sleeper, the party found themselves at the tail end of a spiral that led to the Sleeper's resting place. Huge eel-like creatures sawm through the air and quickly focused on the intruders' presence. Ivory and Lilith were able to cross the spiral with magic, while Luitpold and Ciru battled their way through the eels.

As the party landed strike after strike on the Sleeper, it opened its eye with invreasing frequency, unleashing a massive amount of psychic energy that after just two blinks of the creature's eye became too intense to heal through. The battle became a race to destroy the Sleeper before it killed them all. Fortunately, the final blow was struck moments after Luitpold fell unconscious and he was able to bounce back from the damage in time for the Sleeper's realm to begin collapsing around them.

The inheritors rushed back to their starting point just in time to escape from the crumbling dimension and they awoke in the field, which no longer held the shell of the meteor. Were it not for their injuries, it would have been easy to believe that nothing had happened at all.

Upon arriving in town, the party quickly asked a more trustworthy man than Carroll how long they had been gone. It had been six years since the morning that they'd left.

Ivory immediately headed to the sanitorium to speak with Antimony. Having had several years to harvest the ingredients she needed, Antimony had succeeded in creating a bottle of cure. Ivory downed the dose and felt her vampiric hunger fade away. As she had no need for any further treatment, she went to visit Dulla and inform him. She was surprised to see an unfamiliar man - Hectare - in Dulla's tent, though she quickly realized that it was the slime the party had known as Hector.

During their absence, he had attempted to kill Carroll to no avail and had been resurrected by Dulla into his true form. He also explained that, over the years, Macaby had returned to the hamlet repeatedly, looking for Ivory. Hectare had set about finding a way to stop him and had learned that he had what was essentially a phylactery. He had since acquired it and gave it to Ivory so that the inheritors could decide what to do with it. On her way back to the lodgings, Charles warned Ivory that the rhythm of the heart had increased in her absence.

Although most of the residents of tbe hamlet had not aged appreciably, Virtue and Vice had finished learning Common and grown into young dragons. They had missed Lilith dearly and she resolved to spend the rest of the evening catching up with them once her business was concluded. The other inheritors explained to the adventurers that the remainder of the bandits had attacked while the party was away. However, they had been able to fight them off and kill the wolf they followed.

Its pelt had been nailed to the door of the temple. Piety had removed the relief of the Heart carved into the floor and donned red robes, as well as having developed a stronger magic to use to decimate the cultists. Lilith apologized for her absence and reaffirmed her promise to Piety that she would care out her vengeance.

Over dinner, the party discussed their preparations to enter the manor. Vice asked to accompany Lilith into the dungeon, which Lilith agreed to.

Later that night Ivory contacted Ebony. Ivory explained her absence and her desire to repair their relationship. Ebony remained resistant but at least wished her luck in sieging the manor and was willing to speak with her properly once the estate was secured.
