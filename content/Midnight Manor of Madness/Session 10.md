# Session 10

>[!quote] COVE II
>*Singing, many-voiced, harsh with sea-storms, echoes through these caverns. It speaks of... terrible things I dare not repeat. And yet I find myself, from time to time, humming its notes as we rest around the fire.*
>\- Journal of an unknown inheritor

At the end of the path they were following, the party reached a disused supply room filled with sodden barrels and crates. Piles of refuse took up most of the otherwise empty space. Ebony and Ivory were able to find a few items of interest, which they took with them.

They retraced their steps to the final branch of the cove they hadn't explored. Beyond the door, they found another flooded chamber where a half-sunken ship trawled the waters. Skeletal figures were chained to the mast - the remnants of the crew. Mist poured off the ship, obscuring it while anchor-wielding skeletons swam up from the depths. Eventually, Ebony was able to destroy the ship, which stopped the oncoming waves of crewmen in their tracks.

With their goals accomplished, they returned to the three snakes protruding from the wall. The snakes spoke in riddles, though little of what they revealed was of use to the party directly. They discussed the possibility to removing the snakes but Ivory was certain they would not be able to do so without teleportation magic. For the time being, they left them below.

Back at the hamlet, the four settled down for the night. Junia and Lilith once again suffered strange dreams. Junia dreamt of standing at the edge of a pool of water. She stepped into a rowboat which rowed out and sunk in the middle of the water with her still inside. Lilith found herself standing before the three serpents in the wall, who examined her failing and eventually attacked.

In the morning Junia cast remove curse on herself, to no obvious effect. Over breakfast, Lilith indicated that she wanted to go to the temple and Ivory decided to accompany her. While Lilith prayed, Ivory spoke with Piety about the Fathomless Ones. It was evident that Piety was familiar with them from the severity of her warning that making any promises to them was foolish in the extreme. She advised Ivory to destroy their idols wherever she found them to prevent their influence from spreading.

At the foot of the hill on which the temple sat, Junia petitioned the Deep (by yelling into the hamlet's well) for help in removing the curse that afflicted her. It told her that destroying a golden statue of an angel kept in the temple would reverse the harm that it had done. Without any hesitation, Junia went into the temple and shattered the statue under the effects of the silence spell and disposed of the evidence in the well.

Meanwhile, Ebony spoke with Boudicca at the tavern. She enjoyed hearing Ebony's tales of adventure and shared her opinion that dealing with the snakes would be quite an effort for little reward.

Outside the temple, Ivory and Lilith discussed the potential need to deal with Junia if her allegiance to the Deep became a threat to the safety of the hamlet. Lilith had little hesitation, which Ivory disliked, but ultimately agreed that it might be necessary. Ivory parted with Lilith to seek Dulla's opinion on the Fathomless Ones while Lilith returned to the temple, seeing that Piety appeared to be anxiously searching for something.

Piety told Lilith that she was looking for an idol of Minerva, a goddess who protected her worshippers from the wrath of the water. She declined Lilith's offer of help, supposing that it had simply been misplaced somewhere.

Dulla's perspective on the Fathomless Ones was more even-handed than Piety's. He acknowledged that the Fathomless Ones could be capricious but felt their influence was not necessarily dangerous in itself. The conversation turned to Piety's mysterious knowledge of these gods and, though Dulla had likewise noted her suspicious behaviour, he had no explanation for it.

Ivory attempted to speak with Caroll on the matter - after he had crashed his wagon directly into her, an event that ended in two dead horses and more damage to Caroll than to Ivory. He told her that Piety was seeking to cover up her past. She had taken up her position as caretaker of the church soon after her arrival at the hamlet, prior to which it had been left abandoned.

While Ivory considered this information, Caroll told her that she should plant a blue cultist's amulet on her person to force a confession of some sort. She agreed to do so and left it in the place of the destroyed idol in the temple before joining the rest of the party for their delve into the warrens.
