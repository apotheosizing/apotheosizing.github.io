# Session 7

>[!quote] COURTYARD I
>*He invited me to sit with a smile, bid me to speak. I can't remember what I said, what secrets spilled unbidden from me, for I was too transfixed by the glint of sharp teeth behind his poppy red lips... I stumbled out of the swamp hours later, flinching from the harsh light of the unfiltered sun.*
>\- Journal of an unknown inheritor

Lilith found no occasion to use the serum, as Carroll was disconcertingly forthcoming on the matter. He indicated that leeches were a sign of the growing influence of the Crimson Court, once-allies of Decessor. He had been informed, apparently incorrectly, that they had been taken care of some time ago and it would be prudent for the inheritors to do the same.

The caretaker provided Lilith with a silver dagger and a vial of blood before she left, indicating that she would need them. On the party's way out of town, Ivory stopped by the sanitarium to request an examination of Elvira in light of the recent revelations of the court's nature.

Beyond the lands of the estate stood a swamp encircled by ornate gates. They lay open, allowing the party to pass through to the outermost holdings of the Crimson Court. Within, the party joined by Leo came upon a massive pulsating eggsack protected by several leeches. Carroll's gift of the silver dagger was prescient, as it was more effective than other weaponry in dispatching the creature.

A peculiar sight awaited the party to the south - a food-laden dining table where two nobles were seated. The pair were as surprised by the party's presence as they were by the encounter but civility broke down quickly when Ivory insulted their choice of tablecloth. Further in the party ran afoul of a leech-crocodile hybrid and in the ensuing battle Junia once again nearly drowned from the weight of her armour. However, the party prevailed, managing to destroy two more eggsacks in the leechodile's vicinity.

Having no means to proceed into the muddy water, the party circled back to the main gate and headed west. A short robed figure sat on the ground, parched and famished far more than food could nourish. Using the blood Carroll had provided and some of her own, Lilith was able to collect some information from the figure, who introduced himself as Vivian.

He explained that this place was known as the courtyard and, though all members of the court called it home, most people of note would be found deeper inside. In order to reach the upper echelons of the court, the party would require an invitation. He suggested that the party impress an esquire if they hoped to obtain one.

After acquiring some gold from a trapped chest, the party continued southwest until they found another eggsack. Three members of the court, in varying stages of leechood, were nearby and willing to talk when Ivory opened negotiations. She told them that the party were local nobles - heirs to the Decessor estate - looking to build a relationship with the Crimson Court. Invoking Decessor's name was enough to get their attention, given their prior dealings with him, and they offered the party a drink from their bottles of... wine.

Despite the disgusting nature of its contents, the party kept their composure, earning the approval of the three and an invitation to visit. As soon as their passage was secured, the party turned on the vampires and destroyed the eggsack.

Round the corner, the party passed by a fountain of blood and followed a series of underground passages to a chest with a spell scroll and their fifth eggsack. To the west, faint strings of music could be heard. Two noblewomen were dancing along with the tune and both Ivory and Junia found themselves drawn to join.

Fortunately, Leo and Lilith were not and they killed the musicians before any ill-effects could occur. This drew the ire of the ladies, who attempted to use enchantments to turn the party against itself and failing that, magical apathy to get them to leave. Junia was able to break the rest of the party out of their disinterest to finish the fight.

North, the party reached a pool of water. Something lurked under the water, barely visible through the cloudiness. Ivory dove down to get a closer look, finding that it was a crystal ball. Though it possessed no magic of its own, Ivory gave it to Junia in anticipation of her use of it in divination rituals.

With their goal of eliminating the spawning ground of the infestation in the hamlet complete, the party returned home. Ivory was happy to hear that Elvira was neither a leech nor a host to leeches and accepted her back from Antimony. On the matter of leeches, Antimony noted that these vampires were a strange strain, as their blood was poisonous and they did not share the aversion to sunlight common to the archetypical vampire. She recommended that they be cautious as they continued to explore the courtyard of the Baron.
