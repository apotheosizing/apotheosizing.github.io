>[!quote] COMET I
>*Each second is precious. Time is the irreplacable currency of man's existence, the most valuable thing that beggar or king possesses. And yet, it slips away despite us, outside our control utterly. A mere seconds in that ocean of lost drops? I cannot believe anything but this - each second is worthless.*
>\- Journal of an unknown inheritor

While the rest of the party was digging up Hector's grave, Ivory suffered through Carroll's company. He told Ivory that he had recently taken up woodworking, inspired by Teresa, and offered her a knife so that she could try it herself. The handle of the knife bore an inscription in a language she couldn't read, but she accepted it regardless.

The following day, she spoke with Victor and though he was likewise unable to read the inscription, he recognized it as Celestial. In the course of the conversation, Ivory mentioned to Victor that the party planned to set out for the crash site of the meteor and he requested that she bring back some fragments of it for his examination.

Once preparations were made, the party followed the comet's path to the east. Farmland stretched as far as the eye could see, broken up only by the hills and dales. A strange light seemed to dance through the grass, leading the party up to the crest of a hill atop which rested the meteor.

The light poured through a small crack in the rock that grew larger as the party approached it. Crystal shone inside until it was blocked by the appearance of a large eye that blinked out at the group. Without warning, they found themselves transported elsewhere.

The room they occupied appeared to have walls made entire of thickly packed soil, with doors carved into it in a crude imitation. Touching the door caused the walls to fall away, revealing that they were standing on a floating, translucent island in a sea of light. As the walls fell, crystalline beings appeared in the distance and began advancing toward the party.

Just as it seemed they were about to prevail, the eye appeared once more, enveloped in crystal. It blinked and more creatures appeared. As this pattern repeated, Ebony attempted to shoot down the eye and eventually succeeded just after the fourth wave of enemies fell. The crystal barrier around it shattered and it disappeared, causing a woman to appear at the centre of the island.

She was not hostile to the party's approach, but she was unable to communicate verbally and could only write her own name - Mildred. Seeing the crystals Ivory had collected from around the island, she motioned for some of them and ate them, forming a tongue that allowed her to speak.

Mildred was once the farmer's wife, many years ago, and her time in the Sleeper's dream had transformed her into a being of that realm. Her words were surprising to the party, as the comet had only landed the day before, but from her weariness it was evident that she was telling the truth.

Although she was unable to leave, she was able to help the party do so. Before they departed, she gave the locket she wore to Ivory in the hopes that they might encounter her husband in their travels, so that he might know she still loved him after all this time.

Circling the island six times brought the party back to the hill that they disappeared from and they began their usual walk to the hamlet. Something about it was immediately strange to them, as though things had subtly changed in their absence. The presence of four new grave in the graveyard and Piety's shock at their appearance confirmed that they had been gone for two months on the material plane. In fact, they had been gone so long that Virtue and Vice had gone to look for Lilith and had not yet returned.

After waking up several of the people of the hamlet and one count of breaking-and-entering, Lilith was able to learn from Antimony that the dragonets had gone to the weald. Lilith proclaimed to the party that they would set out to search the area in the morning.

Until then, Ebony and Ivory visited Dulla to provide him with the samples of crystal Ivory had retrieved. He recognized the name "the Sleeper" as belonging to a god that dwelt beyond this dimension but knew little more than that. Things had been quiet in the hamlet since their disappearance, aside from the appearance of a man who matched Macaby's description.

By morning's light - after an explanation of their absence - Ivory delivered the last of the crystals to Victor and asked Ursava to translate the Celestial on the knife. It read "You stab me, I stab you." Though it appeared to be non-magical, Ivory remained wary of it.
