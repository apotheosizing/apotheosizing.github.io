>\- Archaeological notes of Lord Andor Decessor

Carroll told the inheritors that they would need to locate the mouth to reach the resting place of the Heart, though how he could have known this information remained unclear. The infection that the Heart represented had grown in their absence, creeping up to the higher floors of the manor. No matter, as they were descending to its depths.

The space at the lowest point of the excavation had clearly not been touched by Decessor's archaeological crew and it expanded out far beyond what space should have been part of the grounds. A dome of eyes crested the first "room" of the tunnels, apparently unresponsive to the party's investigation of it. Nearby, a group of cultists stood passively, likewise ignoring the presence of the inheritors.

Not everything within the depths was indifferent to them, however, as a "room" filled with teeth - which soon revealed itself to be a closing maw - attempted to digest them. Fortunately, Ciru was able to prevent the walls from crushing them with the use of a wall of force. They continued to follow the winding paths through the flesh until they reached a small chamber with an individual reading at a lectern. They informed the adventurers that the mouth could be found to the south, but lamented that they had not yet been enlightened. The party was able to brush them off without violence and they began to make their way south to find—

Another dome of eyes, another room of cultists, and more familiar sights. It took one further loop of these surroundings for the party to realize that they were going in circles. Lilith used a locate creature spell to pinpoint the location of the mouth and one of the cultists in another of the strange, silent rooms of the adherents indicated that the path north lay through what had appeared to be solid wall but was merely an illusion disguising the path forward.

The mouth was almost a beautiful sight, dancing with flame and containing whirling stars that did not match any arrangement in the earthly sky. Knowing that their enemy lay below, the party took the opportunity to rest for the final time. As they packed up their belongings to examine the mouth in earnest, Carroll strode into the room. He congratulated the inheritors on making it to this place and told them that the price for passage through the mouth was blood. The party quickly restrained him, a situation which he seemed perfectly at ease with, and Luitpold struck with his dagger, spilling the blood of the house of Decessor on the mouth, staining its many teeth red.

Their surroundings changed and Carroll stood, no visible injury on his person, to lead them through the void of space to the Heart. Ivory asked if Carroll had been a servant of the Heart all this time and he finally offered them straightforward answers. Tavrin Carroll had once been his servant and was now merely his tool. Andor Decessor told them that he had devoted his life to studying the Heart and he answered its call - if that made him a servant, then indeed he was.

He had been watching their progress with great interest and believed that only his own descendants could have gotten so far. Ivory agreed, as it was the duty of children to undo the mistakes of their forebears. Luitpold insisted that it was their duty to surpass their predecessors. Lilith asked if destroying the Heart would cause the destruction of humanity itself, as Decessor claimed that it was the seed and everlasting body of humanity itself. He had no idea, though he knew that the souls of humanity had brought it into existence. It was for that reason that gods like the Fathomless sought to destroy humankind, as the planters of these seeds of destruction. Regardless of the consequences, the inheritors had no choice but to act - at the centre of everything, a heart beats. Countless eyes turn upon you and every voice commands you to come unto your maker.

The party brought everything to bear against the Heart that they could muster. Ivory called forth Barrol from the Abyss and Lilith unleashed the immense power in the scroll Piety had bestowed upon her. Ciru took point, absorbing most of the physical harm done by the Heart while Ivory counteracted as much of its psychic abilities as she could.

Luitpold held back to speak with Decessor, asking what he was getting out of all this. He enigmatically replied that this battle would offer him proof and bade Luitpold to join his companions in battle. Little by little, the party wore away at its defenses but space itself folded away from their weapons and it was evident that the battle would not be so easily won...
