>[!quote] WARRENS I
>*We returned from the warrens days ago but that stench... I haven't been able to escape it. I've scrubbed out my clothes what must be a million times, worked my fingers raw, but still it lingers, like an infestation. Perhaps... I am the one infested.*
>\- Journal of an unknown inheritor

Upon entry to the warrens, the party found themselves in a central tunnel from which branched a series of mirror rooms. Arbitrarily, they chose to investigate the northern room first. Inside, they found that the room was littered with discarded offal and a single treasure chest.

Its teeth suggested that it was a mimic but it did not react to the party's attacks. When Junia approached it for a closer look, she was ambushed by a trapper. It succeeded in knocking her unconscious before the party was able to kill it, but Junia avoided any more serious wounds. The inanimate chest contained a ring and a scroll.

In an attached room, the party was hit by an overpowering unpleasant smell. A warning written on the wall in blood warned the unworthy from casting their eyes on the Lord of Rot. Ignoring the portent, the party entered into a room that contained a balezu. For all its posturing, the Lord of Rot fell against the party's onslaught.

Nearby, they encountered a group of cultists who were under the impression that the party were fellow servants of the Lord of Rot. The party played along and learned that they were in the process of cleansing the remnants of their prior devotion to the Heart. Unexpectedly, the conversation was cut short by the cultists falling to the ground, convulsing violently, and then exploding.

The party had no explanation for the gruesome event but decided it was best to take the long way around to the main tunnel. Heading to the second set of main doors, they once again chose the upper path. Inside the door, they were attacked by a pack of death dogs, who bit Junia and Lilith, fortunately only affecting one of them with a disease. Once the battle was over, Lilith was able to cure the strain.

In the adjacent room, the party were surrounded by weapon racks. The majority to the weapons were rusted, though a few remained untarnished. A circle of runes had been carved into the wall. Ivory recognized them as the markings of a portal and the party set to erasing them.

To the south, the party found heaps of rotting rations and what had once been a dining table. A snail-like demon known as a bone whelk was kept in a small chamber in the area, which the party killed. The bone whelk itself was little threat but its nerve-shattering screech upon death was more troublesome.

At the final set of paired doors, the party headed north once more, encountering another group of cultists. They decried the heretics who had abandoned their god in favour of the Lord of Rot and expressed their gratitude to the party when they told them that the wayward souls were dead. Junia took the opportunity to catch them by surprise and the party dispatched them with ease.

To the southwest, the party found a small basin of water that held regenerative properties. Ebony took a flask of the water for use later. In the mirrored southern room, the party found another portal from which six dretches had crawled. Once they had eliminated the demons, they found beyond a chamber with a gleaming suit of armour guarded by flying swords. They nearly proved deadly for Lilith but she escaped with her life intact and the armour in hand.

The final area of the warrens contained a third portal and four bone whelks. Despite being heavily battered by their dying screams, the party was eventually able to retreat far enough away for Ebony to shoot the final bone whelk without any ill effects.

Back at the hamlet, Junia sold one of the bone whelk shells to Gill, who seemed strangely puzzled about being sold an item. He asked Junia if she was a fae, which came so entirely out of left field that she didn't think to ask him why he wanted to know.

Lilith checked in with Victor, who had some progress with his research. He provided a possible explanation for the exploding defectors - they had been smote by the Heart for abandoning it. There had also been notable references to the power of flame, protecting against more than darkness. Additionally, he was able to identify the armour as demonically influenced as well as cursed.

Lilith brought it to the church with the intent to cleanse it of its curse. Piety raised objections to keeping it in a sacred space, saying that it was by its very nature unholy. Lilith believed that unholy implements should be turned against their creators and, though she seemed unsettled by the proposition, she agreed to attempt to remove the curse.

In the party's rooms, Virtue, Vice, and the Reverend were making progress on their learning. Virtue and Vice informed Lilith that they were lonely in her absence. Initially, she attempted to convince Victor to keep an eye on them, but he was not keen on the idea, leading her to conduct interviews to find a suitable caretaker for them among those in the hamlet who knew Draconic. Ironically, the caretaker was ill-suited to the task, but Antimony once raised her own child and was excited by the prospect of being able to teach the two young dragons.

During the interview, she indicated to Ivory that she had done some experiments regarding those brought back via Dulla's methods and extended an invitation to her to discuss it later that night. On her way out, Leo offered the mercenary services of his group to the party, should they have both the coin and the need.

Antimony's experiments suggested that Dulla's work had yielded varying results. Some had no notable symptoms other than a change in eye colour, others complained of nightmares of their bodies failing and the presence of a "strangling heart". This description intrigued Ivory, who explained the party's encounters with adherents of the Heart. Antimony expressed interest in examining one of them, which Ivory agreed to faciliatate. Even more rare were those who had spells of warped perception, where they would see limbs sprouting from others in strange places, and lastly, one who had transformed into a devourer.

Wondering about the reclusive man, Ivory inquired about Dulla's arrival at the hamlet. Despite her experiments, Antimony knew little of Dulla. She directed her to Caroll, who was happy to discuss his arrival. He had come to the village about thirty years prior with a group of scholars. One among this group, who would later become the necromancer of the ruins, killed the rest of their companions to test his necromancy upon - leaving Dulla as the only survivor.

Once the party was back together and discussing their next destination, an another strange turn of events took place. Virtue scratched a leech loose from her body. Neither she nor Vice appeared to have any other creatures on them, and Lilith healed them both magically just in case, but no one could explain the origin of the leech.
