As the tunnels beneath the manor snaked downward, they grew to resemble the bowels of a great creature rather than dirt and stone. After a time, the party found an inscribed magical circle that required the input of three keys. While they explored the premises to find these keys, they encountered a number of rooms that would have been well-suited to the warrens.

One room, located along the western caverns, was lined with fleshy growths of all varieties - stomachs, hearts, lungs. Ciru used thunderwave to break the majority of the in-progress organs but they released a torrent of acidic bile that prompted her to leave the rest of their destruction to the shield guardian.

To the south, they found a lone cultist who appeared to be in later stages of the transformation than any the inheritors had yet encountered. They were quadrapedal, with scorpion-like claws and a tail. Unlike most cultists, they were willing to speak to the adventurers, but only to extoll the virtues of their god. Once they had killed the cultist, the party found that they were holding a severed hand. Collectively, they concluded that this was likely one of the three "keys" they would require.

The inheritors headed down the east branch of tunnels until they encountered a chamber filled with hanging bodies. Unlike their use in the court, these were being used to process nutrients, presumably to allow the Heart to function despite its massive size. The party cut down as many as they could, hoping it might weaken the god.

As the tunnels curved north, they encountered more transformed cultists. Between the two, only one key was found, forcing the party to continue their exploration of the tunnels. The only other soul they encountered was slumped against the wall nearby. A man in full armour who showed no interest in attacking the inheritors. They were not able to learn much of his nature or motives, as he claimed to wish to return to the hamlet as quickly as possible.

His strange affect prompted Ivory to warn Carroll of his intentions and give him leave to kill the armoured man if he did anything to harm the people of the hamlet.

The final transformed cultist - and the final key - was found in a hollow near the inscribed circle. Though it was possible for the inheritors to press on through it, they chose to withdraw and rest to ensure they faced the horrors below with full strength.

Carroll greeted the party as was his wont and informed them that the man in armour was named Cuthbert. He was unwilling to divulge more than the fact that the cultists had some interest in him and the observation that he had done nothing in the party's absence to merit death.

While Ivory went into the woods to destroy Macaby's phylactery, Luitpold continued to investigate whose good graces he had to get in to gain a monopoly over trade in the hamlet. He innocently questioned Boudicca about who handled incoming and outgoing post from the hamlet and learned that, as with most things, Carroll had taken up the task.

Promptly, Luitpold invited the caretaker of the Decessor estate to dinner and a game. For each hot wing they ate, they could ask the other a question that they were obliged to answer truthfully. Not one to eat hot wing and lie, Luitpold learned a variety of mildly interesting but inconsequential details about Carroll and he returned answers in kind. Though the contents of their conversation were mundane, Carroll quickly took a liking to Luitpold and that was more than worth the time and money spent.

Later that night, Ivory attempted to contact the Heart in its dreams. All ability to speak with it quickly vanished as Ivory saw the nature of its unconscious mind. It dreamed peacefully of the cold void of the cosmos and of growing to envelop it all. The idea was fundamentally repulsive to all life but Ivory withstood it long enough to retreat from the Heart's mind without suffering any ill effects.

Not long after, Ciru and Luitpold were awakened in the dead of night by the sound of someone breaking the lock on their quarters. It was Macaby, perhaps sensing the destruction of his tie to eternal life, perhaps hearing word of the inheritors' return from the space behind the comet. He did not get to inform the inheritors either way as Luitpold was able to perfectly mimic Carroll in both appearance and mannerism and drive Macaby away.
