The hamlet at the base of the House of Decessor had a singular road that wound through the untamed weald that encircled the small community. It was on this ill-maintained path that four inheritors travelled in a coach driven by the caretaker of the estate.

Night descended on them as they approached the hamlet but the caretaker showed no sign of stopping. He spoke to the party briefly, answering their questions about their ancestor to the best of his ability. However, the man had grown secretive in his old age and the caretaker knew little of his personal matters.

Unexpectedly, the coach swerved around something in the road and was overturned. None of the party were harmed in the crash but the caretaker was nowhere to be seen. Lacking their guide, the party had little choice but to make the rest of the journey on foot.

As they travelled through the forest, the party was set upon by a group of bandits. They were no match for a band of adventurers and the one remaining bandit fled when given the opportunity. They headed to the south in the hope that it would eventually lead them to the east. A foul smell came to the party on the wind, much to Ivory's discomfort. Ebony was able to recognize it as the scent of stench kows. Despite their smell, the creatures were docile and easily avoided.

Nearby, the party encountered a body lying in the middle of the road. He complained that he was "dying" of the smell given off by the stench kows. The party moved him from the vicinity, reviving him somewhat, and questioned his presence in the woods. Like them, his destination was the hamlet, where he was to meet a friend of his who had received the same letter of inheritance they had. As they were headed in the same direction, they decided to go together.

Continuing to the south, the party happened upon a tree-like object with a red orb in its branches. Writing on the orb warned the reader that placing a torch in the object would only beckon the void. A skeleton lay on the ground nearby, suggesting the fate that might await the party if they took the risk. They chose to avoid it entirely.

Deeper into the forest the trees were laden with cages filled with corpses. The sight was unsettling but nothing sprung from within to attack them as they passed. Another group of thieves (who were less competent than the last group) attempted unsuccessfully to rob the party. Once again, they allowed one survivor of the bandits to escape into the woods.

The path the party walked curved eastward, bringing them to a strange sight. A lone statue stood in a clearing with its palms raised to the sky. Two glittered jewels served as its eyes. Ivory plucked one out, retrieving the jewel but causing the statue, which was truly a gargoyle, to attack. After destroying the gargoyle, the party encountered a duo of bandits in the midst of attempting to unlock a chest. They were markedly more skilled than the others the party had encountered and were even able to knock Junia unconscious before the party defeated them. With no obstacles to doing so, Ebony looted the contents of the chest as the party left.

Supplies were running low by the time the party caught sight of the hamlet on the horizon. The caretaker waited by the gates with a smile, telling them as they approached that he hoped none of them had been robbed along the way. It had become so unfortunately dangerous on the roads of late.

He gave the four inheritors a quick tour of the amenities offered by the residents of the hamlet. Typical shops such as the general store and smithy shared the town square with the sanitorium and a cart selling magical trinkets. The majority of the people who lived in the hamlet were asleep at the late hour but the party was able to meet the smith - a construct named Smith - and the tavern owner, Boudicca.

Boudicca told them that they were not the only inheritors active in the hamlet. Another group who were presumably associates of the friend Oswald had come to meet had arrived recently, though two members of the group had gone into the old ruins and were yet to return.

Once they had familiarized themselves with the hamlet, the party settled into their lodgings for the night. When morning dawned, the party met Victor. He was able to identify several of the items the party had found on their way to the village as magical, being a wizard of some skill. Since the other facilities in the town had thrown open their doors, the party explored the remaining areas of interest the caretaker had pointed out to them.

Morning was turning to afternoon when the party returned to their lodgings to offer to retrieve Oswald and Victor's missing friends from the ruins. The caretaker advised the party that a necromancer and a man known as the Prophet had been reported to lurk in the ruins. They were unlikely to encounter them on a short trip but he warned them nonetheless that these individuals were not to be trifled with.

A sprawling labyrinth sat beneath the ruins that dotted the outskirts of the hamlet. Within the labyrinth, the party headed to the north to find a long hallway filled with niches that ran down its length. As the party entered the hallway, skeletal figures emerged from the niches to attack them. Despite their greater numbers, the skeletons had grown brittle over the years and the party was able to fend them off.

In the middle of the hallway stood the entrance to another room. A rust monster and a cultist lurked inside. The presence of another person surprised the party and his declaration that he worshipped the oldest and greatest of the gods did not do much to explain his presence.

After killing him and the rust monster, the party examined the body to find a symbol of a heart on his person. Though they could guess that it represented the cultist's ancient god, the party could not identify its meaning.
