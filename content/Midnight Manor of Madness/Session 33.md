>[!quote] THE END OF ALL THINGS
>*And no one shall inherit the earth.*
>\- Final written remarks of "Tavrin Carroll"

Having been within the mind of the Heart, Ivory had unique insight into its inner workings. Exploiting that knowledge, she was able to magically shatter its ego, minimizing its arcane offense and defense significantly. The inheritors pressed their advantage and destroyed the corporeal form of the Heart.

There was silence at the end of the world. Tavrin joined the party as they noticed the way the veins of this root spread across reality itself, space and time. He commended their abilities and said that they had proved his theory correct. By killing the Heart's avatar, they had set back its infection of the planet, but that was all they had done. The root was too deep into the fabric of reality to be plucked out with what grew from it and so it would one day sprout again. Humanity as a whole had time but it would eventually run out.

As he had been incorporated into the Heart, Tavrin's soul began to fade away after he gave this final proclamation. Ivory was able to catch some of it before it disappeated, but not enough to ask it more than a few questions.

Space warped around them and the group found themselves back in the Weald. Without speaking, they followed the path to the hamlet and split up to speak with various residents about what they had learned.

Ivory went to Dulla, hoping that his expertise in things beyond this world might offer some new insight or plan. He listened to her explanation of the events beneath the manor quietly and informed her that he would need some time to consider the matter. She indicated that she would return later and set off to speak with the other inheritors.

Luitpold visited Gill, who was as surprised to see him as usual. He would be leaving town in a few hours, he said, and he intended to give Gill the inheritance he had been entitled to. Gill accepted, having no real reason to refuse. After Luitpild conveyed his choice to the other inheritors he disappeared, though he stopped briefly at the newly dug grave of Tavrin Carroll on his way.

Lilith spoke with Piety. She was initially relieved to hear that the Heart was dead and its cultists slain, but the revelation that it would all begin again forestalled any celebrations. Piety remained steadfast, however, and insisted that there must be a way to permanently free the world of its influence. Lilith was doubtful at first but suggested that they might benefit from establishing a formal organization to research the matter further and defend against growing threats in their infancy. 

Lilith brought the idea back to the other inheritors, who were generally supportive of the concept. They also took the opportunity to allocate the land and assets that were now theirs. Only Victor contested Ivory for the noble title and the two were willing to share it by means of a marriage. Ciru and Lilith had an interest in space for their various pursuits while Gill and Victor's companions were happy to simply receive a portion of the family coffers. All avoided discussing the greater matter looming over their heads as much as possible.

Later that night, Ivory returned to Dulla's only to find the place abandoned. A letter left in his tent indicated that he felt there was no hope for his - or anyone's - future in the hamlet and there was nothing to be done to combat the return of the Heart. Ivory was undeterred and used the various papers and ink he left behind to begin research of her own, starting with what she could glean from Decessor's soul.

According to what he knew, this cycle of events had occurred several times before, with each incarnation of the Heart gaining strength and speed of recovery. Based on the trends he had observed, they had perhaps two years until it could manifest an avatar again.

She set aside her notes and broke the news first to Lilith, who remarked that there was nothing else to do but to accelerate their plans. In the morning, they would tell the rest of the hamlet and see who was willing to try to fight against the inevitable, even if it was ultimately pointless.

Not long after, there was a knock on the door of the inheritors' quarters. Lilith answered, finding that news had quickly spread of their plans. Macaby hoped to join them in these first days of the defense of the world and Lilith invited him inside to discuss the matter further.

He would be the first to join them and, the inheritors all hoped that night, not the last.
