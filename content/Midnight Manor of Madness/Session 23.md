# Session 23

>[!quote] COURTYARD III
>*I have often heard my fellows joke about the perils of being invited to dinner. Failing to observe the correct social niceties, particularly where food and drink are involved, has been the death of several careers, so they say. I had always laughed along with these jokes but after tonight... Well, they seem in poor taste.*
>\- Journal of an unknown inheritor

After a night of bloodsports, the inheritors chose the court as their next destination. As they stepped through the doors of the lavishly appointed halls, a pair of guards checked their invitation and found it acceptable. One of them informed the party that the Viscount had been awaiting their arrival but neither offered any directions to where he could be found.

In the absence of instructions, the party made their way west. Two vampires were seated at a table, embroiled in conversation, upon their arrival. The vampires did not appear to be surprised by the presence of guests and insisted that the four join them for what they termed the first course.

Ivory and Lilith each partook of the drink while Ebony and Teresa did not, and thus the party narrowly avoided being percieved as rude. Ivory left a generous tip of 10 gold each before rising from the table and following the hallway north.

A cat of the same breed as Elvira was lounging in an alcove. The party learned that it had a taste for blood when they attempted to lure it out and had that revelation cemented when it tried to bite them shortly afterward.

In an adjacent room, they encountered Vivian. He was happy to provide what information he knew about the Viscount in exchange for fresh blood.

Continuing along the hallway and then veering west brough the adventurers to another dining room. Its occupants were much less cordial, demanding that they be served their meal. Matters quickly came to blows, with the party emerging victorious.

The party took the opportunity presented by the empty room to rest. During tbe ensuing hour, Lilith found herself growing hungry, though it was not satisfied by any amount of rations

Finally, the party reached the end of the hallway and turned east to find the tables where the second course was being served. Two women were enjoying a hearty soup that Lilith was unaccountably interested in. Unlike the first table, Ebony and Teresa grew tired of Ivory's careful social manoeuvering and chose to attack the vampires. Despite their attempt to incapacitate Ebony and Ivory, the party was able to defeat them.

At the southern end of the hall, the inheritors came face-to-face with the Viscount in a grotesque room of hanging bodies. Ivory informed him that she was interested in gaining an audience with the Countess and he replied that the Countess was likewise interested in meeting Deccessor's heirs.

The moment the invitation to the Countess' court had changed hands, Ebony and Teresa sprung into action. The Viscount attempted to use the bodies placed around the room to counteract the damage done by the party's attacks but Ebony caught on quickly and began destroying them before he could make any use of their blood. Once his means of recovery was eliminated, it was only a matter of time before he fell.

Upon their return to the hamlet, Lilith made her way to the temple in the hopes her god might lift the curse that she suspected had befallen her. Struck with a strange anxiety, she made her prayers in the graveyard nearby rather than the temple proper before seeking more immediate assistance from Antimony.

The doctor quickly determined that Lilith was indeed displaying further symptoms of one strain of vampirism - the Crimson Curse. Like the vampires they had fought, she was vulnerable to silver. After taking a blood sample, Antimony advised Lilith to visit Dulla for a more magical perspective on her possible solutions.

On her way there, she was followed none too subtly by Carroll, who pointed out that praying in a graveyard was a suspicious activity. She ignored him and entered Dulla's tent for a brief discussion.

He was aware of two claims of a cure for the Crimson Curse. One was creating an antidote using the blood of an elder vampire. The other was boasted by Macaby as a means of preventing himself from becoming a vampure during his hunts. Dulla stressed that neither were guaranteed to work but Lilith took to the task of investigating both nonetheless.
