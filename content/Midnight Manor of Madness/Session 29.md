>[!quote] COMET II
>*Today is [the ink here has run messily over the page]'s birthday! I know he doesn't like when I make such a fuss over it but I want to at least do a little something. Gill was able to procure some of that wonderful chocolate from the continent. It's a little pricey, of course, but I've been saving for some time. I'm intended to surprise him at dinner but, honestly, it's been hard to remain quiet about it! I hope he enjoys it.*
>\- Journal of a miller's wife

Ivory's turning into a vampire did not go over well with Ebony. She was frustrated by what she saw as Ivory doing exactly the sort of thing she had been trying to prevent the moment Ebony wasn't around. Ivory argued that she'd done what was best in the situation and that she wasn't going to remain a vampire for long, but Ebony was unconvinced. She stormed out of the inheritors' lodging, saying that she was washing her hands of the whole matter and going back home.

In the awkward silence that followed, Carroll took the opportunity to tell the adventurers that he had recently come across another relative of theirs who was interested in acquiring the estate. A merchant by trade, Luitpold Dietrich was eager to get to work. The party, with no real alternative, accepted him into their ranks.

After taking some time to get acquainted, the party set out for the site of the comet's impact. The eye of the Sleeper was still visible in its shards and they were pulled once more into its strange demiplane.

The experience was similar to their first foray into the comet, with walls of dirt giving way to a vast, flat plane filled with holes that dropped into nothingness. These spaces proved to be much more troublesome than last time, as Ivory's shield guardian fell from the platform and she had to expend significant effort and spell slots to retrieve it. The presence of Virtue and Vice also complicated matters when one of the elementals summoned by the Sleeper knocked them out of the air. Fortunately, they were not permanently harmed but they were clearly very frightened by their brush with danger.

As Mildred had indicated, the party found her husband in this realm. Like his wife, he had been transformed by the comet and seemed intent on killing the inheritors for the tresspasses. Ivory, remembering the locket and the message she had been given by Mildred, reminded the miller of the woman he had loved in life. This alone began to erode his transformed body and, with the locket in his possession, the party laid his spirit to rest.

However, the Sleeper had disappeared, meaning that their work in this dimensionnwas not yet complete. On the way back to the hamlet, Ivory spoke to Lilith about Ebony's response that morning. Lilith felt that though she wouldn't have done the same, Ivory had done nothing wrong. She recommended speaking to Ebony about it later, once they'd both had more time to think about it.

Carroll had dug the inheritors a new set of graves in their absence. He claimed that they had been gone for years but Oswald informed them that they had only been gone for a week this time.

Luitpold wasted no time upon his return, immediately seeking out Gill to size him up as potential competition. Being the only general store in the hamlet, Gill was surprised by the presence of a rival. Luitpold was no stranger to using underhanded tactics to get ahead in the world of business but Gill had the benefit of a long history in the hamlet - it was hard to say who might come out on top in the end.
