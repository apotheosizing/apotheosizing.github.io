# Session 2

No physical barrier prevented the party from turning back but nevertheless when the trio set foot on the second floor of Castle Void, they could only move onward. The residue of death was just as obvious here as on the previous level, though in a different form. Blackened decomposition fluid festered in every corner of the room and "water" stains on the flagstones made it clear that many, many adventurers had met their end here.

Like the doors of the first floor, a sigil was worked into their surfaces, with this one depicting a dodecahedron encompassed two semi-circles. Stepping foot beyond the threshold revealed what could only be described as a sewer. A flood of rats poured out of the nearby waterway and attacked the party but they were able to keep them at bay. When it became clear that the large pipes that transported the "water" were large enough to squeeze through, the party headed inside.

It was a difficult fit but it seemed they were not the first to pass this way. A small room occupied by a single corpse in a fur cloak had been filled with the corpses of rats. Carmilla animated the skeleton to bring along with her. This segments of pipes terminated in a strangely clean room filled with art of various animals. A door requiring another sigil-key stood at the center of the room so the party set out to find the two halves of the key.

Back at their starting point, the party headed through a door to the west. Carmilla noticed that little spikes littered the hallway as it curved south to a barred door. The metal of the door was cool to the touch but nothing appeared immediately dangerous. Opening the door, however, quickly changed that. A torrent of water pushed everyone in the hallway back, causing the spikes to shred through the soles of their boots and bite any exposed skin unlucky enough to make contact with them. To add insult to injury, the room that had held the water had nothing of interest inside it.

Further west, the party found a room filled with a complex array of levers and a wheel. A diagram had been carved into one of the walls but it had eroded to the point of being unintelligible. Spinning the wheel opened the door to the south to reveal a room filled with liquified humanoid remains. Hidden there was a large black pudding that waited to ambush unsuspecting individuals.

The party took some time to experiment with the levers but they didn't seem to affect anything about the door. However, they learned that the door would eventually return to a closed position after a few dozen seconds. Kill-sin tried, unsuccessfully, to hold the door open but fortunately once the black pudding was dead they could simply walk to the next room. There, they found an identical contraption that would allow them to head back the way they had come.

After a short rest, the party headed north. The second of only two humanoid corpses - this one bloated and "water"logged - was floating in the room and Carmilla quickly added it to her entourage of undead. Kill-sin expressed some distaste for this in light of the horde of reanimated corpses they had had to fight through but he acknowledged that the more bodies that stood between them and hostile denizens of the castle the better.

From this point, the party had their choice of heading to the left or right. They went left into a room where a walkway of planks had been placed over a layer of filtering nets that caught most of the large refuse in the fluid below. An unfortunate soul had died in the layer of fluid between the nets and the planks, leaving behind their bag which Carmilla was happy to take with her.

The final room on the western path led to another flooded room. Only four wodden posts, smeared with grime, poked up from the "water". While trying to jump across to the door on the eastern side of the room, Kill-sin fell into the fluid and was attacked by a school of carnivorous fish and a gigantic electric eel. In order to rescue him, Carmilla summoned a cloak of spirits to destroy the fish. Not wanting to lose the effect of the spell, she tore off through the door and followed the waterways until she ran right into a crocodile.

In the crocodile's mouth, the shine of one half of the sigil-key could be seen. Although she had to sacrifice her skeleton to the endeavour, she and Kill-sin were able to slay the crocodile and continue on with a few minutes left on the spell. The corridors of the castle began to loop back toward the south. One large room, rarely dry for what they had seen so far, was filled by a large and deep pit and held the distinct glow of the lantern for Scavenger's shop.

Taking the risk of opening one last door before the spirits dissipated, the party entered a hallway filled with the sound of the grinding of gears. There was no immediately visible source of the sound but it quickly became clear that the machinery powered a trap when Carmilla walked right onto a pressure plate. A pressurized blast of acid caught her full in the face and the machinery ground to a halt. Fortunately, with this forewarning, she was able to safely trip the other mechanism from a distance.

A closer examination of the two machines revealed a small crawlspace connecting the two. Kill-sin was able to pry the grate aside and see what was inside. He reported that graffiti in at least three hands had been left there. Each had a conflicting account of their encounter with the twins, including one group that had destroyed the glaive Gravewarden.

By this point, Carmilla's celestial guardians had faded away and the party returned to a more measured approach at exploration. She and Kill-sin returned to the room where Scavenger had set up shop. A thin layer of floor remained around the edges of the room and previous adventurers had left a set of pitons and a rope that would make passage safer. These protections soon turned dangerous as the rope snapped, surprising Kill-sin and sending him tumbling into the pit. However, the impact of his fall sounded relatively close, prompting another look into the pit's depths. Carmilla noticed that the "bottomless pit" was in fact an illusion over a nasty set of spikes. Some healing magic set Kill-sin to rights and the pair was able to reach Scavenger's shop without further incident.

In exchange for another hundred gold, Scavenger provided some information about the guardian of this floor. A construct formed of volcanic glass had been crafted by the architects of the castle and imbued with the ability to control the creatures that called the sewer their home. As she made her purchases, Carmilla tried to ask Scavenger about the messages they had found from other adventurers but she was less than forthcoming. She did, however, indicate that the recreation of the glaive after its theft or destruction was only natural - it was an important part of the design of the castle.

The party went on their way after picking up a few items and potions, heading to the other side of the pit. Another room set up with net filters awaited them. A large hole had been punched in the filters, leaving behind only the hand of the adventurer who had been standing there when the nets broke. Carmilla was able to carefully retrieve the hand before passing through south door back to the room where she'd reanimated the zombie. The east path from the foyer was the only traditional path the party had not yet explored. A cylindrical room filled with water separated the parts of the eastern path they'd passed through earlier from parts unknown but the party decided to forgo heading through when the zombie fell in and was torn apart by hungry crayfish.

The other door led into a innocent-looking room that centered a pedestal. A shimmering conch shell was waiting there to be taken by any enterprising adventurer but the fact that it was a trap was patently obvious. Careful examinating revealed that removing the conch activated a spike trap that plunged up and down at irregular intervals. Carmilla was able to disable the mechanism and take the conch, which would sell for a decent sum to an interested buyer.

The waterways that forked around the room with the sigil door had not been fully explored so, with great reluctance, Carmilla and Kill-sin squeezed into the pipes once more. Their persistence was rewarded by the peculiar sight of a single daisy blooming in a small patch of dirt that had fallen into the castle. Carmilla, charmed, took it with her.

The final room had another pedestal, this one holding the other half of the sigil-key. Remembering the conch shell, Carmilla took closer look and discovered that the true key was hidden on one of the sides of the pillar. It was easy enough to pry off and create the complete key.

The construct that awaited the party in the sigil chamber was a bizarre sight. A swarm of rats in a parody of humanoid shape orbited around a large dodecahedron. The rats protected the fragile dodecahedron as best as they could and it was capable of summoning more vermin to its aid as Carmilla and Kill-sin struck them down. However, even outnumbered and worn down, the party held their own by striking the dodecahedron with fire, weakening its hold on the rats and exposing the volcanic glass at its center.

Eventually, with both Kill-sin and Carmilla on their last legs and the dodecahedron near shattered, the battle would be decided by a single attack. In a final desperate maneoeuver Carmilla hit true with her torch and destroyed the construct, causing the remaining rats to flee. The party took the opportunity to rest as soon as they could, knowing that things would only grow more dangerous as they pressed on.
