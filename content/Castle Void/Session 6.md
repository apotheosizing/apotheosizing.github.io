# Session 6

The doors to the floor Eldora guarded were emblazoned with the image of a bell overflowing with golden light. On the offering table of the shrine to Eldora was a neatly folded piece of parchment bearing an entreaty from the woman herself, asking for the adventurers to stand down and be brought into the fold. The door requiring the sigil-key was located to the south of the room, leaving the party to choose between paths to the east and west.

Opting to head west, the party was confronted by what was at first glance an empty hallway. Still, something about it discomfitted them. The low vibration of a tuning fork emanated through the hall, setting the party's teeth on edge and afflicting them with a curse, but the party was able to slip through the door in the middle of the passage to escape it. A lone bell stood in the chamber and ringing it transported the party in the air over a room filled with articulated statues. Kill-sin was able to use the broom to catch himself but Carmilla fell into their midst. Fortunately, she was protected by the cloak of displacement long enough to destroy the statues.

Two doors, each leading to a bell, stood at either end of the room. The party chose to ring the brass bell first, arriving at a room carved of a strange glassy stone. An absence waited at the center of the room. The absolute nothingness offered to take something away. Carmilla immediately named the curse and the entity complied, removing the curse along with all but a sliver of her strength.

After healing, they once again faced their choice of two bells. The adventurers rung the black bell which returned them to the room to which they had initially been teleported. As the green bell had not yet been rung, the party did so, finding themselves in a room with a diorama of the city. Castle Void floated above it, observing the movements of the people as they went about their little lives. At the entrance to the castle was a keyhole which Carmilla circumvented to receive a small chest filled with magic items.

Continuing through the area, the party reached a semi-circular room dominated by a wall carving inlaid with precious metals depicting Eldora healing a wounded man. The metal filigree formed a sigil on the group which, when a healing spell was cast upon it, transported the party to a mirrored room. The carving here showed Eldora in the heat of battle.

A door to the north east led into a long hallway filled entirely by a massive automaton poised to guard against intruders. However, the party had entered from behind the automaton, affording them just enough time to dispatch it before the automaton could crush them. At the end of the hall was a diorama of a battle. Two soldiers dressed in opposing colours held each other in the middle of the carnage.

Another door to the south opened into a room where two statues holding stone bells posed questions. The first asked after the party's motivation for coming to the castle. Kill-sin recounted his desire to earn his name while Carmilla explained that she sought whatever secret it had been built to house. The second questioned them on what they planned to do if they escaped the castle alive. Carmilla truthfully answered that she would return to devoting herself to her life's work. Satisfied with their honesty, the statues allowed them to pass.

The last in the southern chain of rooms played host to another contingent of stone soldiers. A device that rung a bell was housed on the ceiling and it was only upon seeing that it was active that the party realized that a veil of silence had been cast over the room. Destroying the bell broke the spell, allowing Carmilla to make short work of the statues.

Returning to the room to which they had been teleported, the party took the door to the southeast. A sprawling tapestry telling the tale of Eldora's heroic rise covered the walls. Interpreting it was made simple by accompanying text in Celestial providing commentary and clarification.

Eldora, once a humble farmhand, found her calling on the field of battle. When the fighting was done, rather than return to her peaceful life, she began a storied career as an adventurer where she met two lifelong companions in Zaera and Tasura. In the last scene of the tapestry, the trio discovered the legendary dagger known as the Sever-Soul Blade. Despite its significant name, neither Carmilla nor Kill-sin knew of its capabilities.

After making their way through a narrow path of statue soldiers, the party emerged in a room that contained a statue of Eldora. An inscription at its base bade the successful adventurers received their reward. The chamber behind her held one half of the sigil-key. Moving back through the room provided a new angle on its interior, allowing the party to see the light of Scavenger's lamp behind the southern wall.

Carmilla, as always, attempted to ask her a few questions, chief among them what she and her companions had done with the Sever-Soul Blade. To Carmilla's surprise, Scavenger answered: ask Eldora. Her customary information gave little in the way of additional clues as to Eldora's weaknesses, though it emphasized that she always sought to pull a surrender from her enemies rather than consign them to death.

Seeing no further path forward, the party retracted their steps until they returned to the first half of the floor by striking the sigil on the floor of the room carved with Eldora in her aspect as The Valkyrie. The neglected door in the mirrored room contained a second statue and accompanying sigil-key piece.

The time had come to face the second of the three companions. Eldora awaited the party in a floating plane of dioramas peopled with those who had thrown themselves on her mercy. She welcomed them to join her and ask any questions they had. Carmilla was keen to take full advantage of the opportunity to speak with someone with both the knowledge and inclination to provide the answers she sought. In response to the question of the fate of the Sever-Soul Blade, Eldora explained that she and her friends had built Castle Void to keep it from falling into the wrong hands.

The Sever-Soul Blade, she said, could be used to cut the tapestry of existence, for good or for ill. Using the blade, they had cut the castle from reality and linear time, leaving only one thin string to tether it to the universe to ensure it served its purpose of housing the blade. This nature was the cause for the replenishment of the castle century after century and, presumably, it was this thread that Scavenger hoped the party might sever to end her friends' long vigil.

Before the inevitable fight, Eldora gave the party one last chance to surrender. Carmilla, in whom the first inklings of a terrible idea had begun to take root, politely refused. Eldora was not called Battle-born without cause. She was a fearsome fighter who nearly brought the party to their knees even in an uneven battle. It was only by exploiting her offer to end the battle without further bloodshed to strike the last few blows needed to kill her that the adventurers prevailed.

As Eldora drew her last breath and the floating villages around them began to fade, Carmilla made her a promise: the good that would be done for all mortal life when she used the Sever-Soul Blade to end the tyranny of death over existence would far outweigh the deaths of all her followers above.
