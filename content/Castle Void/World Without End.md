# World Without End

They called her Our Lady of Eternal Life.

The blood of the final death was long dried from the blade when the woman who cut Death from the fabric of existence stepped out of the maw of the castle from which none had ever returned alive. More than one of the condemned souls slumped at the entrance was certain they were seeing things when first she was glimpsed. Then, when the stunned silence was finally broken by a whoop of elation, the whole city seemed to throng forth to carry her to the court of the good king himself.

News of the fall of Castle Void - its conquering - spread hand in hand with the realization of what the triumphant hero had done with the artifact at its heart. The first soul found on his deathbed - a farmhand unlucky enough to have been gored by his own steer - who did not expire when the death rattle escaped his chest was a miracle. The eleventh was a revelation.

At first, people embraced the new world with open arms. The first flush of excitement overrode all logic and sense. Who wouldn't want more time with those they loved? With no fear of death, those too timid to risk life as well as limb in the wild places of the world could travel without fear. Accidents and miscalculations were no longer fatal and, with the balm of magic at general disposal, that greatest of mortal limitations was lifted to much fanfare.

There were things lost, as it was with all change, but for the vast majority the Lady was hailed as a saviour, the deliverer from Death.

It took a handful of days before the reality of things began to set in. The elderly grew more infirm, the old aches and pains inflaming, their memories stretched thinner, the machinery of their bodies slowing and stuttering but unable to come to a halt. There was no comfort of a promised end to pain and suffering; Death no longer answered the prayers of those who begged for it.

Life, with Her old enemy slain, enjoyed a period of ascendancy. The land exploded in a snarl of growth. Predators starved while prey flourished and the ever-increasing population flowed outward into towns and cities. Some were fascinated by the first of these encounters, the meeting of the civil and the wild, but these unwelcome bedfellows soon came into conflict.

Of course, birth and death were two halves of the wheel into which the Sever-Soul blade had been wedged. With the lack of its turning, stagnation now reigned supreme above them both, putrid and festering in the earth and its creatures: a mire that would swallow them all.

Elation turned to horror quick as fresh fruit spoiled and those very people who had hailed the coming of a new age learned to fear its unmapped span. The shape of eternity - a world without end - was too vast and too awful for thought. Many sacrificed and supplicated for deliverance but the Lady could not be found, nor the blade she had wielded, and after all a dagger made to pare away the yarn of reality was not the tool needed to repair it.

If such a thing existed at all, it was beyond any grasp still strong enough to reach for it. So sank the world into the detritus of life. So came the last ending, interminable.
