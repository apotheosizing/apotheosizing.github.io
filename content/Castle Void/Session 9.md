# Session 9

What remained of the castle fell away into nothingness as the true void nestled at the heart of the fortress unfurled. Empty firmament - that which astronomers called the dark between spheres - was all that was. Kill-sin, though no longer afflicted by the curse of silence said nothing to Carmilla as she made the final preparations for what lay ahead. Calling upon her god, she restored Kill-sin's lost strength and petitioned for the aid of an angel.

As they traveled the unbound nothingness of space, a small portion of darkness peeled off from its kin, resolving into the shape of Scavenger. For the last time, she shared what she knew of Tasura as he was, though certainly the thing that waited for them in the depths bore no more resemblance to him than to any other living soul. All that remained of him were the oaths he had sworn: to protect those he loved and to prevent anyone from laying hands on the Sever-Soul blade for ill.

Like dusk in reverse, the world began to resolve itself around them. The black of the void gave way to soft grass, ruffled by a gentle wind. The sky - for now there was a sky - above held no sun but was bright as a summer's day and the faint sound of waves recalled the gentle movement of the ocean. Signs and sounds of life sprouted up along the path toward a large arena of stone that likewise formed in their presence.

The last reminder of their true surroundings was the absence standing at the center of the arena: the oaths of Tasura stood sentinel against the coming intruders. Setting foot within the bounds of the arena drew its notice and within Carmilla's mind was an absence in the shape of the word DEVOTION.

She questioned whether it truly embodied that oath. After all, she had stepped over the corpses of two of his friends to arrive here and saw no protection of his preventing her from destroying them. The absence seemed to solidify, becoming tangible enough to enact its will on the world, and set about proving the depth of its adherence to Tasura's oaths.

Kill-sin and the angel did what they could to strike at the shadow that made up the thing, sheering off chunks of the shadow that filled up its space. But it was when Carmilla mentioned that one of Tasura's friends still lived and brought Scavenger into the arena at daggerpoint that the void took true stock of them. If it was to keep the oath of protection Tasura had sworn, it must intervene.

In the blink of an eye, it intercepted the arm that raised the dagger to Scavenger's throat and erased it from being. This was not enough to stop the spell that sapped the essence of Scavenger's very life force, weakening her such that she didn't even have the breath to flee. In return, the void, with a wave of its hands, broke Kill-sin against death's own door.

This was not enough to deter Carmilla, who reduced the skein of Scavenger's life to a mere thread. As Eldora had done for her, she offered the void a change at surrender. It had no intention to stop, using its power to teleport them both across the arena and, in the same fell swoop, halve the candle of Carmilla's life just as she had to Scavenger. But even this was not enough to stop what came next.

Carmilla offered one more opportunity for the absence to end this, for the second of the two of his oaths she had already forced it to break. It refused. At the exact limit of the spell's range, spikes of burning wood erupted from the stone, impaling Scavenger.

One final oath was all that remained of the thing that was once Tasura. With the Sever-Soul blade in its hands, it cut the angel out of existence, sliced away the world beyond the walls of the arena, and severed the threads of Carmilla's past and, last of all, her faith. Utterly defenceless, she could do nothing but watch as it plunged the blade into her heart.

Kott, however, could. Disappointed with such a sloppy showing, he reached out and tore away the last few minutes from the fabric of reality, returning things to the state in which they were when the party had stepped through the door at the end of his temple. He warned Carmilla that he could not do so again and advised her not to make the same mistakes twice.

Events played out much the same as they had the first time, with a few key differences. Rather than call upon her deity to restore Kill-sin, Carmilla kept that request for intervention in reserve. Once more, she stepped into the arena with the intention to break the last of the oaths that made up the void of Tasura. As she had foreknowledge of the being's tactics, she was able to avoid the loss of her arm and properly restrain Scavenger, making preparations for her death much more easily accomplished. 

Almost as if she too recalled the way things had gone the first time around, Scavenger was able to slip free from Carmilla's hold - but it was too late. Even as she attempted to flee the stakes that rose up around her, the last of them found its mark.

Once more, the void wielded the Sever-Soul blade to devastating effect. The angel was erased from reality, all avenue of escape destroyed, and the hand that had reached out to kill Scavenger severed at the shoulder. However, before he could cut away the last of Carmilla's power, she called for her god's intervention, disarming the embodied oath of the blade. Rather than clattering to the ground or appearing in Carmilla's hand, it floated at the center of the arena - closer to Carmilla than the absence - and there was no means at its disposal to stop her from reaching it.

Recognizing this, it welcomed Carmilla to try to take it; attempting the use of the blade itself destroyed most who sought it. With her remaining hand, Carmilla gripped the hilt of the blade and--

--was nowhere. Even in comparison to the void, there was truer nothingness here than any plane of reality, as this was beyond the walls of existence. The human mind interpreted these surrounds as the demesne of two figures with a vast tapestry stretched between them. One ripped the threads from the end of the tapestry, tossing them off into nothing. The other gathered up those loose threads, weaving them back into the pattern to create something new. At the center of this cycle stood Carmilla and the Sever-Soul blade. The notice of the thing that unmade fell on her and that mere brush of acknowledgement would be enough to break the will of any worldly creature. But, she did not unravel. Instead, she held tight to the blade and--

--saw the threads of existence around her. The moment that reality settled back into place, Carmilla severed the thread of Tasura's oath, ending its existence forever. While she considered the mutitude of threads around them, she addressed Kill-sin, who had managed to survive this version of events. She still intended to honour her promise to Kott but, she said, Kill-sin had offered his aid to her first.

Kill-sin stopped her before she cut the thread of his past, asking to do it himself. After all, he knew exactly what it was he wanted to remove. Anyone would be wary of relinquishing the Sever-Soul blade with no guarantee that it would be returned to them. Still, Carmilla handed it over to Kill-sin. Surprise flitted across his face before he was pulled into the place Carmilla had seen. Unlike her, his will unthreaded under the gaze of that which unmade existence and, before he could even express shock, Kill-sin was gone.

Carmilla took up the blade again and, as she had said she would, cut away Kill-sin's past, removing the last trace of him in the fabric of reality. Then, she fulfilled her promise to Kott, freeing him from his duty as guardian of the blade by cutting the thread of his existence. Kott did not go quietly, making a last ditch effort to retain the integrity of his thread by altering reality himself with a wish, but nothing could withstand the Sever-Soul blade in the end. It was simply a matter of two cuts rather than one.

Alone in the empty castle, Carmilla took a deep breath, and then she cut the woven thread of Death from the tapestry.
