# Session 5

Unlit white candles lined the staircase that led the adventurers deeper into the heart of the cultists' den. Rather than flame, a cool magic light floated above the wicks. The sigil on the doors of this level of Castle Void depicted a winged humanoid wielding a longsword and a bell staff. The door opened onto another shrine to Eldora.

To the south a bell clapper had been placed on a pedestal. Four cultists stood in the four spokes of the strangely-shaped room, staring transfixed at the clapper. The party proceeded in with caution but found that the cultists were completely uninterested in them. They would likely need to take the clapper at some point, thus disturbing them, however that was not yet necessary.

Through the west door, the audible clank of some mechanism could be heard. Numerous pendulums swung back and forth over a room-sized pit of spikes. Using the flying broom they had purchased from Scavenger, the party was able to navigate without too much difficulty, though they did misjudge their timing a few times and collide with the pendulums on their way.

The following hallway took them north, then south. A small circular room at the inflexion point of the hall contained a number of bells set around a podium. A mallet lay on the ground nearby, making their purpose clear. The end of the hallway held a locked cell door behind which was the engine that powered the pendulums on the other side of the wall. Carmilla picked the lock and was able to figure out how to deactivate the engine.

Now that it was safe to pass through, the party headed through the other door in the room with the pendulums. Many of the acolytes who lived on this level had congregated in this room, where a winged lion lay in repose. On a collar around its neck was one half of the sigil-key. Once the cultists had been slain, Carmilla was able to bribe the lion with the various human entrails she had picked up throughout the dungeon to allow her to approach and take the piece of the medallion.

A faint light shone in the wall of this room, indicating the site of Scavenger's shop.  With her usual brusque manner, she provided what information she had about the guardian of the floor - a minor angel named Eae who had come to serve Eldora. Further south was a stark reminder of how many of her other devotees had been twisted: a room where broken humanoid bodies hung from the bodies of the bells. The remainder of this path led to the impassable doors of behind which Eae waited.

Back through the central room to the south intersection, the party was brought up short at a foreboding sight. A man wearing a blood-spattered bell on his head had been chained to the parallel wall. Between him and the door was a low stone table on which a page of sheet music had been laid. The man did not react to attempts at communication but taking the sheet music from the altar caused him to rip his manacles from the wall and attack.

Before each attack, he struck the bell on his head and set it ringing and some strange force seemed to animate him, as even strikes that should fell him seemed not to land with the force they should. Carmilla realized the mechanism at play and held the bell still while Kill-sin struck the killing blow.

Using the sheet music, the party was able to play a short song on the bell drums they had seen earlier, delighting an expectant audience of ghosts. On their way, they dispatched the four cultists guarding the clapper and used it to ring one of the bells in Eldora's sanctuary.

The final available path forward lay east of the central room. Bloodied battle standards were leaned against the walls and a small celestial inscription called for the ringing of bells for the dead. Carmilla spelled a bell into being and rung it, allowing the party to pass through safely. The next room contained the bodies of two acolytes and an animate statue of an angel that sprung to attack the moment the door was open. Once the threat was neutralized, they found that one of the acolytes held a small booklet of morse code used by the cult, which they took with them.

One last room contained only a black bell inscribed with the words "In resonance, understanding." Puzzled by the seeming lack of the other half of the sigil-key, the adventurers rung the bell and found themselves in a different space. The door through which they had entered the room led to an unfamiliar room. A large bell and its smaller twin sat in the center of the room. The small bell emitted a pattern of chimes that the party was able to replicate on the larger bell, silencing it. In the chamber beyond, a soft golden light fell on a white bell bearing the same words.

Another ring brought them to another room identical to the one they'd left. A large stone ball was moving back and forth across the length of the rectangular room outside but with careful timing the party was able to evade it wth only minor scrapes. A green bell and one last change in scenery led to a room guarded by bell creatures and two acolytes. Rather than engage them in battle, Carmilla was able to thunder step both herself and Kill-sin to the brass bell at the other end of the room, grab the sigil-key piece atop the bar that held it, and escape.

After a rest, the party went to meet Eae. A circle of acolytes lay prostrate at her feet but the angel paid them no mind - her attention was already on the intruders who had entered through the door.

Unlike her fellow guardians, she put a question to the party, asking why they had come to profane this place and kill Eldora's acolytes. The party explained the alluring dangers and mysteries of the Castle but such justifications paled in the face of her zealous purpose. Still, she offered one chance to end things without bloodshed: if the party were to repent and swear themselves as acolytes of Eldora, they would be welcomed. The adventurers refused and so battle was joined.

Eae was a fearsome opponent but her greatest strength proved to be her greatest weakness when Carmilla was able to disarm the angel of the bell she had been gifted by Eldora, stunning her and opening her up to the final deathblow. With the open question of the righteousness of their own cause ringing in their ears, the party descended to the sixth floor of the castle where Eldora herself stood as sentinel.
