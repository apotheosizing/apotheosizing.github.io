# Session 1

The halls of Castle Void rang with the death knell of the doors closing on two new entrants. Carmilla and James, with their subsidized equipment in hand, walked into the foyer to a grim sight. A handful of emaciated and hopeless people and an almost equal number of corpses were huddled against the walls, unable to bring themselves to go any further. Each group was willing to trade their remaining equipment with the adventurers for their rations and the party took up a few of them on their offers.

Most important of these was a orc who was willing to exchange his aid for five rations. James accepted and asked for his name. He said that he had cast aside his old name when he entered Castle Void and would only take up a new one when he forged his own heroic legend. Carmilla also took one of the corpses for use as an animate dead within the castle.

Beyond the foyer the corridors were coated in humanoid gristle. Cautiously, Carmilla sent the reanimated skeleton ahead of the party to set off any traps laid to catch adventurers. Almost immediately the skeleton was pulverized by spikes that erupted from the floor. Examination of the area revealed a set of eye markings low to the ground that activated the trap when movement was sensed. James was able to make his way across, covering the eyes along the way and allowing the rest of the group to pass without issue. 

The door at the other end of the hall was etched with a sigil depicting a glaive stabbing a figure in the chest. In the circular chamber beyond the door, a number of undead wandered about, all of which had a blackened stab wound in their chest. After neutralizing the undead, Carmilla was able to determine that the wounds had been inflicted postmortem by a glaive. The necrosis around the wound was magical in origin.

A series of five doors branched off from this central chamber. The party headed southeast first. The remnants of another group of adventurers were found there and it seemed that they had come to some conflict. Among the carnage, they spotted a rat carrying a small diamond as it fled from their entrance. Further on there was a smaller room occupied by a crawling claw wearing an expensive-looking platinum ring. James was ambushed by a number of other claws when he entered the room but with the efforts of the entire party, all of the claws were captured in various containers.

However, there was one more trick up the room's proverbial sleeve. James and the orc fell prey to illusion magic that made their other companions appear to be undead. Carmilla was able to allow them to realize that they were being affected by magic by writing a message on a scrap of paper and after that to identify the ring as the source of the spell. Rather than risk it happening again before they could break the curse on the ring, James shattered it.

Returning to the central room, more undead had risen up from the mulch of flesh on the floor. The party was able to deal with them and move to the eastern door. An unsettling presence of efforts at consolidating most the gore from these rooms around two frames with skin stretched over them made them all anticipate another horror at the end of the hall but instead they encountered a friendly flameskull. He introduced himself as Seda and asked the party to test out a set of bone chairs he had made. He explained that he'd grown bored of roasting every intruder in the castle and recently taken up this hobby. Considering their material make, the chairs were not terrible.

Seda asked for the party to procure a skull for him and Carmilla immediately thought of the wizard from the previous set of chambers. She retrieved it and, in exchange, Seda gave the adventurers what was clearly one half of a circular sigil. He told them to give his best to the twins when they saw them.

On their way back to the main chamber, they briefly diverted down the split in the hallway they had ignored earlier. They encountered a poisoned rat that seemed to have eaten a bad piece of flesh. James, ever the bleeding heart, used his magic to save the rat's life. By way of thanks, the rat gave him the diamond it had taken earlier.

Two more doors remained in the circular room. Yet another amalgam of flesh had formed within but although it had the worrying property of speech, it moved too slowly to be any threat. The party simply walked around it to the north. A number of zombies guarded a door that seemed to bulge out from the wall. Unlike its many counterparts, it was missing the sigil, instead having a circular depression in its middle. Carmilla called upon the power of her god to vaporize the undead, avoiding an actual fight, but there was no passing the door until they had the other half of the medallion.

The last corridor split into two small halls segmented by grates. A set of switches along the wall set a combination of grates on both sides of the wall up or down. Carmilla and the orc took one way while James went down the other. As they worked their way through the switches to get them all to the other end a horde of skeletons ambushed the party. Fortunately, the grates did not much hinder their efforts to destroy the skeletons.

From the room with the switches, the party had their choice of north or south. To the north, a strange obelisk waited with a ring of corpses arranged around its base. At the party's approach, it segmented into three parts, each of which had the same four symbols: a glaive, a skull, an eye, and a figure laying prone. The bottom two segments were surely the sigil they had seen throughout the castle but either the skull or the eye would be appropriate for the top. They decided to try the eye first and were relieved to find that it was the correct sequence.

Now that they had the opportunity to look around the room, they spotted what seemed to be a ring of light emanating from a solid wall. Investigation revealed that the wall was not solid at all. A woman named Scavenger was sequested behind it, having set up a shop. In addition to various magic and mundane items, she had some information about the twins that she was willing to share for a fair payment. Nikos and Iro were their names and they had grown up as thugs-for-hire before being given their station in the castle.

After making a few purchases, the party headed down the south path. All the rooms of the castle were filled with viscera but they had to wade through guts by the time they were more than a few feet down the hall. The mess obscured a large pit that suggested this had once been a midden before the sheer volume had caused it to overflow. Both Carmilla and James nearly slipped into the pit but they were able to scramble out to the other side and even net a set of rings on the hand of some unfortunate soul.

One final door stood between them and the other half of the medallion but it was no ordinary door. A man had been absorbed into its surface and, if his behaviour was any indication, trapped there for so long that his mind had begun to break. Seeing no other option, Carmilla simply killed the man, causing the door to open to admit them to the pedestal that held the sigil fragment.

Before going to confront Nikos and Iro, the party took a rest to attune to the magic items they had bought from Scavenger. Thus prepared, the trio set the medallion into its cradle and stepped into the chamber beyond. Although they were formidable fighters, the twins were outnumbered and at a disadvantage against fresh opponents. Nikos fell first and was joined by his sister not long after.

James took Iro's glaive - Gravewarden - as a trophy of their first victory in Castle Void and the orc decided upon his name: Kill-sin Chaderton. It had not been easy but the group had conquered the first stumbling block for those foolhardy or desperate enough to venture here. After a proper meal and some sleep, the party ventured deeper into the bowels of the castle, only able to pray that their wits and their prowess would carry them even further.
