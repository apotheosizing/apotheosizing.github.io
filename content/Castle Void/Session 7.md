# Session 7

The same strange purple glass that was found in the rooms above - perhaps the material of the void itself - was the sole stuff from which this floor was made. Granite doors carved with the image of a dragon led directly to the sigil door to the north, prompting the party to head south.

An elaborate diorama of an ancient temple peopled with three figures clearly modeled after Zaera, Eldora, and Tasura animated as they passed through the door. The miniatures played out a small scene of opening a chest. From within emerged a blade of anti-matter than moved to attack first the figurines and then Carmilla and Kill-sin.

They were able to neutralize the sentient spell and head through a door to the west, where they traveled through a strange twisting hallway which terminated in little more than a small platform in a vast space. Crystals of purple glass grew up around them and another absence waited with an offer to remove something from them. Carmilla asked it to cut out her weakness and, as before, it complied - leaving her just shy of unconsciousness.

Further south, they were confronted by an illusory Tasura who made it clear that the third member of the party of adventurers who had discovered the Sever-Soul blade was a deadly martial fighter. He was attended by a number of weaker minions, one of whom Kill-sin impaled with Gravewarden to raise as a zombie.

Northwest was a room separated down the middle by a pane of glass. On the other side stood two nothics and a pedestal containing one half of the sigil-key - which quickly became three to mirror the number of beings that had stepped through the door. Each of the nothics mimicked the movements of the party, which they were able to manipulate into taking the key and bringing it to the dividing wall. Carmilla was able to break a small hole in the glass and retrieve the key, narrowly avoiding being snatched by the nothic.

Venturing into the next room, the unnerving sight of a flowing waterfall of corpses and an altar with a bowl and a knife laid atop it. Carmilla was able to bleed what little remained in the zombie in exchange for a sizeable portion of gold.

The party returned to the chamber where they fought the false Tasura and took the second of the doors within to the east. Both walls of the hall beyond were plated with mirrors, creating an endless set of reflections stretching in both directions. Curiously, the reflections were not of Carmilla and Kill-sin. From the sight of the Gravewarden in the hands of one of the mirror-people, Carmilla inferred these were echoes of their predecessors.

As they advanced toward the door at the other side of the hallway, each of the reflected parties met a grisly end from various traps. However, there seemed to be nothing of the sort in the real hallway. Beyond the door was a loom seeingly abandoned just before the completion its project. Kill-sin was able to add in the last few threads required to finish the rug.

On their return trip through the hall of mirrors, the threat of danger became palpable. The humanoid mulch of every fallen adventurer coated the floor in a fine gristle and, at the end of the path, a person with an obscure visage awaited them. They muttered incessantly and while they were not actively hostile, Carmilla did not want to take any chances. She banished the spirit back to where it came, though a lingering feeling that she had known them remained.

The party retraced their steps to the diorama room, taking the door to the east. Mesmerizing rainbow light played across the walls of the hexagonal room, illuminating a number of hanging corpses that looked as though they were wrapped up with hard light. Some trick of perception made these bodies disappear, replaced by the sight of a nest of phase spiders. Despite knowing they were present, the party could not reach these creatures while they existed on the ethereal plane.

With no other option but to continue on, the party headed north. Unlike the artificial nature of the rest of the floor, this "room" was the natural formation of a cavern. Fragments of an unknown whole glittered on the ground, attracting the attention of the party. Picking up one showed an image trapped within that, when rejoined with the many other pieces, revealed a gentle memory of Tasura and a young dragon wyrmling playing in a waterwall. Even without having encountered Scavenger and her wealth of information, it was obvious to the party who guarded the descent to the eighth level of Castle Void.

From here, the party moved east to a room filled by four opaque glass domes. One had been cracked open, revealing the dessicated corpses of a humanoid and a dog within, and screams for help emanated from the remaining three. The party immediately tried to open these other domes and was rewarded for their altruism with an ambush by the undead creatures trapped inside and one of the phase spiders.

The second of the four spiders chose for its moment the party's passage back through their lair to the south, where they emerged into another mirrored chamber lined with reflective glass. Unlike the straightforward mirrors they had encountered elsewhere, these stretched and distorted their images into monstrous reflections that stepped through to attack. Combatting the reflections was briefly complicated by the appearance of the last of the phase spiders but fortunately the party emerged victorious.

The light of Scavenger's shop shone on the wall here. She was more terse than usual while processing the group's various transactions, with the perhaps finally permanent death of one of her companions weighing on her thoughts. Still, Scavenger recounted the tale of Tasura and Ahuru, a boy and the dragon who he had befriended and grown up alongside.

Only one unexplored chamber remained to the east. A circular chamber housing a large pillar of glass, intricately carved with geometric designs. The other half of the key had been worked into the design but Carmilla's sharp perception was able to pick it out. Removing the half key caused a large crack to form in the pillar, spreading quickly to the glass that made up the room itself. The adventurers were nimble enough to escape before the room shattered entirely, though a last glance behind them revealed that flesh of all things bubbled up through these cracks.

All that remained was the fight with Ahuru. His appearance was unlike any dragon of the world from which they'd come, with a sinuous eel-like body. More than that, the once mighty dragon had been diminished by his long imprisonment, but his conviction still held true. He fought tooth and claw to destroy the intruders but stood no chance against the newly-born ambitions that carried the adventurers toward the resting place of the Sever-Soul blade.
