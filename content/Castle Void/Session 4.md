# Session 4

In the depths of the castle, a chime sounded. Fittingly, at the doors of the fourth level, the party found that the sigil was carved with the image of a shield bearing a bell. The initial antechamber contained a six-armed statue littered with small offerings and numerous white votive candles marking it as a place of worship. Each of the statue's hands held a weapon, the most peculiar of which was a large bell it wielded like a flail.

Three bells missing their clappers were hung at the back of the room, though one clapper was resting at the foot of the statue. The bells were inscribed with Health, Skill, and Strength. Ringing the Health bell granted the party the ability to cast a powerful healing spell once while on this floor.

The party found a training area beyond the door to the west, occupied by a handful of acolytes and more experienced members of a cult, as marked by their robes and armour. Carmilla attempted to speak with them, curious about their faith, but all of them had taken a vow of silence and were not interested in treating with intruders.

A number of more peaceable acolytes were occupied with candlemaking in a small chamber attached to the training room. Another attempt at communication was made but even writing was forbidden under the oath they had taken. Unlike their fellow acolytes, they did not intend to fight and the party allowed them to flee without interferance. As they passed through the training room once more, Carmilla raised one of the priests there as a zombie.

Nearby, the party came upon an unsettling chamber. Several corpses were interred in the walls of the room, entirely entombed in wax. The corpse at the center of the room had one half of the sigil-key embedded in the wax of its chest. The wax corpses sprung to life when Carmilla attempted to take the key and, as the party was still injured from their fight in the practice room, forced the party to retreat without it.

They headed south and were likewise brought up short by one of the castle's defences. A translucent gold image of an angel wielding a scythe hung in the air as a sentinel against further progress to the south. Carmilla identified it as being a guardian of faith when it rent apart the zombie she sent into the room to examine it. Wearing it down by sending more undead against it would be too costly and enduring it themselves was far too dangerous, thus they went back through the central room to the east half of the floor.

A quaint little room with a fountain was a welcome respite but it did not last. Reflections in the water manifested in the room as ghosts which were dispatched one by one until the room was silent again. The faint ringing of bells drew the party through a door to the north. Hundreds of bells hung from the ceiling in the short hallway beyond.

A portcullis blocked progress through to the room on the other side of the hall and a lever was set in the wall by the entrance. The party left the zombie behind to pull the lever and walked to the portcullis before commanding it to do so. Pulling the lever rung the numerous bells and the sheer wave of sound caused the zombie to explode but the party was able to pass through the portcullis safely.

An empty bell stand was the only thing of note in the room. Carved into the bar was the wisdom: "Without substance, motivation has no purpose. Motivation without substance is useless." To the west and east of the room, two short hallways each with their own magically-infused ceiling layer of bells led either a stock of bell bodies (engraved with the word 'substance') or a box of strikers (each bearing the word 'motivation'). Braving the bells to reassemble the bell granted a boon to the person - namely Carmilla - who completed it.

The other passage from the room with the fountain played host to an enormous bell. A single acolyte was gripping the rope that would ring it with white knuckles. It was clear that they intended to ring it and alert all the members of the order to the presence of intruders. Carmilla was able to avert this by casting command and ushering the acolyte into the barracks where the other acolytes had fled. East of the bell was a cremation furnace tended by two priests. They summoned forth the fire as an elemental to aid in their battle but the party was able to strike all three down. Within the furnance was the second sigil-key fragment.

The light of Scavenger's shop glowed faintly in the absence of the flame. She was taciturn as ever when asked about the faith of the cult present on this floor, though her usual price applied. Long ago, a powerful cleric named Eldora served a god of war whose named had been lost while hers survived, for from admiration of her deeds and the spread of her teachings, a group of fanatics devoted to her rather than her god proliferated from the core of her followers. Carmilla wondered who Scavenger had learned all this ancient history and she indicated that she had been personally acquainted with Eldora, though she refused to explain any further.

Following the hallway and the scent of burning metal south, the party discovered a forge manned by an automaton smith who took their name from their station. Several cracked and burnt bells littered the room. Forge was eager to speak with someone who was not a zealous follower of Eldora and vented their frustrations with making nothing but bells to a sympathetic party.

They requested that the party retrieve one of the first bells they made, with which they were no longer happy, from the room with the wax corpses. In return, they would melt it down to augment any one of their existing magic items. The adventuers agreed and then asked to borrow a set of tongs from them to safely pull the sigil-key from the furnance. Forge allowed them to do so.

Fortunately, though they had initially had difficulty with the corpses, one of the priests assigned to work the furnance had worn a necklace of fireballs that the party used to melt the wax guardians in moments. The other half of the sigil-key and the old bell were then easily obtained.

The party returned to Forge and, as they worked to deform the bell, questioned them about a way to bypass the guardian of faith to the southwest. They pointed out the grooves worked into the stone of the room and explained that the acolytes used their bell staves to deactivate the guardian by tracing the pattern. Since they had expressed frustration with their work, Carmilla asked if Forge would like to leave with the party but Forge said that only those who were bound by threads of causality - like the adventurers - could move freely between floors. Still, they appreciated the offer.

Once they had rested, the party returned to the guardian of faith and followed Forge's instructions to dispel it. A long hallway led south to a hexagonal room containing an upside-down bell ringed by twelve candles. All but one was lit. Lighting the twelfth candle and ringing the bell caused gravity to reverse for the one who rung it but Carmilla's recently purchased broom of flying made returning to the ground no great hardship. The door at the other end of the room opened in response to the sound of the bell, opening into an expansive cathedral.

Wax-laden curtains segmented the room into several private areas but made it extremely flammable. No sooner had a procession making its way toward the sigil door at the back of the cathedral turned to face the party than they had been incinerated to a man. Using the sigil-key, the party found themselves face-to-face with the reverend father of the congregation they had destroyed. His considerable magical prowess had been bolstered by the very same bell that gifted the adventurers with a major healing spell but with the use of all their skill and cunning the party emerged victorious. It seemed, however, that the followers of Eldora were far from eliminated...
