# Session 3

Through a small hatch in the floor, the third level of Castle Void awaited. Almost as if it was a counterpoint to the previous two floors a fine layer of dust - punctuated by breaks where other adventurers had passed through - covered every surface. The sigil on the door depicted a hand with a closed eye on its back holding a dagger.

The first hallway was almost entirely filled with razor wire, with a heavy crossbow emblazoned with the floor's sigil that trained its sights on Carmilla. Figuring that the thing that set her apart was the torch in her hand, she tossed it away into the room, causing the crossbow to shoot the torch and turn inert. James and Kill-sin were able to cut through the razor wire without issue thanks to their darkvision and the party passed through the hallway into a large central room. 

A tall pillar topped with a ball of light dominated the room, drawing the eyes away from the black tapestry at the back bearing the sigil of the dagger. Four doors led off in various directions. The party took the southeast door into a small room where some poor soul had died. The body had been completely riddled with arrows, indicating the potential danger within. Examination of the surrounds revealed a pressure plate just past the threshold.

Having seemingly avoided harm, the party went to retrieve the adventurer's backpack only to find that it was a mimic. A trapper peeled itself away from the floor to ambush them as well. Fortunately these creatures were no match for the party. They headed east to a chamber where a large iron cage was suspended over a pit. Numerous skeletons filled the cage, prompting Carmilla to restore one to life and have it empty the cage of valuables. James leapt up to the cage to free the skeleton, straining the braided cord that kept it suspended, but he managed get clear with the skeleton in tow before the cage tumbled into the abyss.

Continue further to the end of the southeastern path, the party encountered yet another mimic in a room that seemed to have a bizarre slope to all of its tiles. Carmilla realized that the tiles were in fact sagging de to a lack of anything beneath them - almost the entire room was designed to send unwary explorers plunging into a pit of acid below.

Returning to the place where the cage had hung, the party opened the door to the north. A circular room with a mirrored wall sat innocuously on the other side, with one half of the sigil-key sitting openly on the floor. Knowing better than to trust the room's appearance, Carmilla sent the skeleton inside to activate the inevitable trap. Sure enough, the moment it picked up the fragment of the key the door slammed shut behind it. James was able to pry the door open in time to defend the skeleton from the shadowy creatures that had emerged to destroy it. The adventurers were rewarded on their defeat of the shadows with a glimpse of a small secret chamber that held a few treasures.

The party made their way back to the room with the pillar and followed the long hallway to the northeast. After a brief and fruitless interaction with a complex mechanism reminiscent of the one Carmilla had run across on the previous level complicated further by a sigil-activated balista, the party came across a strange sight. Three shades stood watch over three corpses illuminated only by the light of a candelabra holding three bone white candles.

Upon James setting foot inside, the voice of the shades asked if they had the pleasure of speaking with a wise thief. To ascertain his wisdom, each of the shades asked him a single question. James answered two of the three correctly by providing cautious and cynical responses. The shades concluded that he was worthy enough of their aid and vanished, leaving behind a number of magic items.

The end of the hall held two alcoves only visible from the right angle. One was trapped with a blade that James ran into but the other held another half of the sigil-key - though it became clear this was a counterfeit as the eye in the sigil was open rather than closed.

Two doors remained in the central room. The party opted to head through the southwest door first. A large circle of light beamed down through a gemstone afixed to the ceiling to illuminate the sigil engraved into the floor. The shadows formed into malevolent creatures that were immune to even Carmilla's magic but when the party had the idea to drag the shadows into the light their weakness was exposed, allowing the party to kill them.

A small room nearby was occupied by three target dummies, each wearing a sign indicated where and how to strike them. Carmilla took up the task and managed to successfully hit all three which caused a chest filled with rewards to appear. The last room in this wing was filled with complete magical darkness - however, the lingering aura of the spirit guardians around Carmilla exposed the presence of two creatures within that sought to ambush the party. With the element of surprise removed, the party was able to draw the battle out into the hallway to nullify their enemies' advantage.

The final door in the pillar room terminated in a room with a single chest resting on a raised platform. The party initially assumed this was another mimic but the faint sound of ticking indicated it was trapped in a different manner. Carmilla and James were able to disarm the explosive charge and clockwork arming mechanism before any harm befell them.

One more short hallway took the party west to a little theatre. It played out a small pantomime show about the antics of a foolish noble and a trickster fool. The performance was surprisingly entertaining - until the noble beat the fool to death onstage and struck out psychically at the watching crowd. By the time the party had regained their wits the curtains had been drawn, though the second sigil-key half was left on the stage.

Initially at a loss as to how to proceed, the party returned to the pillar room. It was then that they took note of the black tapestry at the back of the chamber. Behind the tapestry was hidden a simple door locked by the sigil-key. As the party had been unable to find Scavenger's shop, they were uncertain what lurked beyond the door but they certainly did not expect the woman they saw. It was Scavenger.

She maintained her usual weary demeanour in the face of the party's shock and said simply that she had a duty to perform. Knowing Scavenger, there was nothing they could say to dissuade her. She was lightfooted and struck hard and fast but she was outnumbered three-to-one.

It was clear, too, that her heart was not in the fight; whatever oath bound her to slay intruders into the castle had lasted longer than the zeal that had led her to swear it. When it was clear she was beaten, Scavenger shrugged off her cloak and walked back into her shop.

Carmilla and James were keen to learn her tale but Scavenger did not give information on the guardians of Castle Void without payment. Once the requisite 100 gold changed hands, she reluctantly spun the tale of Zaera the Light Thief who stole and killed without compuction but never ever broke her word. Although she admitted to knowing very well who had contructed the castle and why, she refused to tell the adventurers anything more.

Still, Carmilla could not help asking two parting questions when their business was concluded: if the architect of the castle was slain, would she be released from her debt? She confirmed that she would be. The more important question was whether she wanted to be. Zaera replied, with a thin-lipped smile, that she would not have offered her custom to those plumbing the heart of the castle if she did not.
