# Act 2, Scene 2: Death Comes in Threes

DANIEL: The path through the foothills eventually led the party to Tsolenka Pass, a narrow stretch that would take them over the Luna river. An old wall had been erected here long ago and though it had fallen into disuse, it held strong.

A sheet of green flame occupied the way forward behind the wall's portcullis. Immediately, the adventurers concluded that it was magical fire and realized that they had no means of extinguishing it. When WREN attempted to climb the way, the two gargoyles perched atop the gate awoke.

These gargoyles kept infuriatingly out of the party's reach, forcing WREN and BARNABUS to ascend the wall to fend them off. One of the gargoyles managed to stun the adventurers and kill BARNABUS while he was unable to fight back, leaving the party with one fewer capable fighter.

Perhaps worse than that, THE MISTS OF BAROVIA reanimated his corpse as an enemy to his former allies. WREN was able to force one of the gargoyles to ground, allowing VASILKA to finish it off and take care of the zombie BARNABUS, while the other had finally run out of ranged maneouvers and was taken down by CONSTANTIN and KAI.

ROSAI hurried over to the body of BARNABUS and cast gentle repose to keep their fallen comrade's soul from being cast off into the ether and I arrived with an extra to fill his player's role.

THADDEUS was slightly bemused but pleasant enough to the party and quickly endeared himself by being able to banish the green flames. The adventurers, having expended many of their resources in the battle, took refuge in the abandoned guard tower for the night.

Not long after, they witnessed a cloaked rider crossing the bridge on a black horse. None could identify this individual, as the wind and snow obscured anything that would be recognizable. Nonetheless, the rest of their night was peaceful and they returned to the road the next day refreshed.

As they reached the bridge, they were stopped once more by a headless rider, who proclaimed that where they stopped, someone was due to die. Confident that they could deal with the creature, the party stood their ground when they attempted to ride past, prompting the dullahan to reveal just how out of their depth the adventurers were.

CLARA, exasperated: They went all of 100 feet in four hours? The audience must have enjoyed that immensely.

DANIEL, sagely: It's about the journey, not the destination.
