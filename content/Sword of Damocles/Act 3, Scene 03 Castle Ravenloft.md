# Act 3, Scene 3: Castle Ravenloft

DANIEL: As their investigation of Berez's only remaining landmarks had revealed nothing but old ghosts and ruins, the adventurers concluded that there was little to be gained by spending any further time in the town. They headed back along the eastern road they came in on but found themselves quickly approaching another settlement - or rather the same settlement. The dilapidated buildings of Berez were just barely visible through the MISTS. Following the southern path and walking backward along either of them likewise brought the group circling back to Berez.

ROSAI broke from her companions to speak with her sister, hoping she might have insight into their predicament. CHY’KIRA revealed that all the adventurers gathered in Berez were the souls of those who had died opposing STRAHD. The force of their anguish and their desire to prevent the party from meeting the same fate was what was keeping them in the safety of Berez.

The shocking knowledge that her sister had died led ROSAI to seek out WREN, whose family had been among the first to suffer the afterlife of Barovia. The two spoke about their feelings and ROSAI reaffirmed her intention to help the people of Barovia, even if it seemed impossible from their circumstances within it.

[CLARA gives a bitter laugh. DANIEL sighs.]

DANIEL: As CHY’KIRA refused to allow the party to leave, they set about searching for their own means out of the spatial loop warped by the spirits’ grief. THADDEUS recalled that the place in Berez where they had encountered the strongest emotional force was the former residence of the burgomaster. The adventurers returned there with the goal of making their case to the ghosts.

As they were slowly crushed under the emotional weight of the dead, KAI and WREN led the effort to persuade them to free the party. Their impassioned words eventually moved the ghosts and returned the fabric of reality to its rightful state, though Berez now stood eerily empty.

Having unraveled the mystery of the town, the group turned their sights to Castle Ravenloft. Unlike the majority of their travels across Barovia, their approach to the gates of the castle was utterly uninterrupted. The grand doors stood open to receive them.

CLARA: When they crossed the threshold, we were waiting for them. All the servants of the castle escorted the adventurers to the dining room at their master’s request. 

STRAHD had few words for his would-be killers, as there had been many opportunities beforehand to speak freely. The party attempted to gauge his willingness to allow or assist them in breaking the cycle that consumed the land. He only laughed at their naiveté and left them to explore the castle.

We likewise left them to it. They took the eastern staircase to the second floor of the castle where they happened upon the chamber that held ARGYNVOST’S skull. Taking it with them was, at this point, not feasible but they intended to take it with them when they fled the castle with the weapon that rested here.

After exploring the servants’ quarters, they came upon the skeletal remains of the last of Ravenloft’s soldiers which quickly moved to take up their arms once more.
