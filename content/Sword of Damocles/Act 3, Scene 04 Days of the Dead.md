# Act 3, Scene 4: Days of the Dead

CLARA: The skeletons were no match for our seasoned adventurers and they quickly moved past them to the north, in hopes of exploring the only area of the second floor yet untouched. There, they encountered RAHADIN, who rose from his desk to confront them. Though he was bound by the shackles of duty, he was no match for the party.

DANIEL, morosely: I’ll miss him.

CLARA, in an aside: Will you?

DANIEL: Won’t you?

CLARA, ignoring them: In RAHADIN’S study was a long-neglected staircase that led to a small chamber illuminated by a brazier. An inscription at its base made it clear that the brazier functioned as a teleportation device. Tossing the [stone] into the brazier took them to the tomb of STRAHD.

There were no physical obstacles to leaving the chamber but as they made to raise the portcullis, three failed creations of STRAHD rose up from the grave dirt. Knowing intuitively the purpose of these three vampire spawn, the party took the initiative and killed the spawn before they could even offer token resistance. Before they left the tomb, they destroyed STRAHD’S coffin on ROSAI’S recommendation.

Beyond the portcullis lay the catacombs of Ravenloft, where the party spent three hours of precious stage-time.

DANIEL, firmly: We are *not* going to enumerate the contents of every tomb, but here are some of our crown-pleasers.

CLARA: The animated skull that always lies and, next door, the animated skull that always tells the truth.

DANIEL: A pit full of coffins that the party was teleported into and also retreated to for a rest.

CLARA: A ghost who briefly possessed KAI and was the catalyst for the respite in the pit.

DANIEL: The grave of EUDOCIA MARKOVIA. Her spirit bequeathed her incanted thighbone to her dearest friend, TATYANA.

CLARA: BEUCEPHALUS, the alive nightmare, who followed the party around but otherwise did nothing of note.

DANIEL: CHY’KIRA’S and PATRINA’S graves, which discomfited their siblings.

CLARA: At the northern extremity of the catacombs lay the tomb of SERGEI VON ZAROVICH. His brother had thrown himself across the slab and wept for hours, much to the party’s annoyance. The sword they sought was doubtless among the items with which he was laid to rest but they could not safely retrieve it without drawing STRAHD’S ire.

In their injured condition, the party sought to find somewhere to regroup or a means of escape from the castle. To that end, they took the western pathway out of the catacombs. Of course, nothing could be easy for them and the hallway revealed that it was trapped, sending THADDEUS plunging below into an ancient prison, leaving his allies unable to reach him above...
