# Act 3, Scene 5: Curtain Call

DANIEL: With no other recourse, the rest of the party elected to join THADDEUS in the prison below. There, they found the enchanted blade Pluto which, though it was not the sword they sought, would give them an edge in what was to come.

The prison and its accompanying torture chamber were filled with the corpses of those who had died there. These reanimated undead attacked the party, draining their resources but otherwise posing little threat.

Luckily for the adventurers, behind the raised gallery of the torture chamber was a door leading to the room with the brazier. At least one of the brazier’s destinations was beyond the walls of the castle - the mountain spire - which would certainly be beyond STRAHD’S grasp but the party was unconvinced that they would be able to return easily to the castle if they left it. As such, they chose to attune the brazier to the castle’s peak, hoping that it would be remote enough for them to barricade themselves in for a proper rest.

Fortunately for them, this isolated tower had only an attic door leading out into the elements and a single staircase that could be monitored by VASILKA, who did not need to sleep. The tower proved to be safe, though doubtlessly the adventurers had no pleasant dreams that night.

Once they had awoken, the party quickly moved to descend the staircase, at which time they realized why their choice of hiding place had been so effective. The eastern tower was host to a crystalline construction known as the Heart of Sorrow, defended by a number of animated weapons and the structural instability of the tower itself under the Heart’s command. KAI and VASILKA were immediately knocked off balance, KAI saved only by his quick thinking with the glider recovered from the catacombs and VASILKA by her sturdy construction.

The party turned all their efforts upon destroying the Heart before it could make another attempt at causing them all to fall to their deaths. Unleashing all their magical and martial might, they were able to do so - though the silence in the tower made way for the creatures that had been kept at bay by the danger of the Heart to accost them.

Four vampiric spawn, two of them wearing the faces of CHY’KIRA and ECTOR, rushed to ascend the stairs and rip the adventurers limb from limb. In the end, they proved no match for their opponents, as they had the higher ground.

The party took the opportunity to explore the eastern wing of Castle Raveloft, including the royal chambers which seemed to have been held in perfect stasis since the night it had all gone wrong. Intriguing as the many sights of the castle were, the party knew that their only remaining obstacle to the freedom of Barovia lay in the catacombs. Without further ado, they retraced their steps through the castle until they stood outside SERGEI’S tomb.

STRAHD, who had exhausted his weeping, greeted the party without much grandeur. The party made one final appeal to him, still holding on to a hope for a different future that he could no longer feel. It was THADDEUS who struck first.

Sheer numbers and ROSAI’S possession of the Amulet of Ravenkind made the battle’s conclusion foregone, but STRAHD still had a few tricks up his sleeve. VASILKA, who had been constructed for him, was turned to STRAHD’S defense, much to her horror and the moment he could no longer bare the sunlight he vanished into the very stones of the castle.

This brief respite allowed the party to muscle past VASILKA to the tomb of SERGEI. KAI and THADDEUS were able to pry open his coffin and retrieve the Sunsword, the final weapon they needed to slay the Count.

Inevitably, STRAHD reappeared in a blazing fireball that put ROSAI on death’s door, extinguishing the sunlight she had conjured. The rest of the party managed to remain conscious but sustained terrible injuries. However, STRAHD himself was on his last legs. KAI was unable to call forth the searing light of the Sunsword but he nonetheless wielded its hilt, stumbling toward the monster who had doomed Barovia with the last of his strength.

It was there, in the shadow of his brother’s tomb, that STRAHD VON ZAROVICH was struck down forever.

The moment STRAHD died, VASILKA was released from his control, allowing THADDEUS to stabilize ROSAI without risk to himself. As the reality of their victory set in, the heroes of Barovia collapsed to the stones of the crypt, their exhaustion finally hitting them.

And the curtains closed on our production with this moment of peace, snatched from the jaws of despair.

[CLARA crosses the stage to the curtains, which they rest a hand on the fabric in a moment of hesitation. DANIEL joins them. This is their only chance, in the split-second when both actors and extras are released from their obligations.]

CLARA & DANIEL: That is where we came in.
