# Act 2 Intermission

[Lights up on a dilapidated office. There are no windows to speak of and the room is sparsely furnished with shelves, a desk, and a straight-backed chair. CLARA has commandeered this, sprawled out across it like liquid. DANIEL is pacing back and forth. Between the two of them is a deck of cards set up for a game. It is DANIEL’S turn.]

CLARA: As much as I complain that we’re overworked, underpaid—

DANIEL: Underappreciated—

CLARA: I do wish we had more to do.

DANIEL, laughing: Other than lose to me at cards?

CLARA, with a scowl, ignoring that last: Shut up and play.

DANIEL, stopping: ...Do you have any sixes?

[CLARA sighs and placed four sixes, the whole deck’s worth, face up on the desk]

DANIEL, peering: Oh, so we should be getting back to work soon.

CLARA: Evidently.

[With a clatter, the door opens. Despite its suddeness, neither CLARA nor DANIEL jump. RAHADIN enters, dusting off a riding cloak that is damp from snow. He squints up at the stage lights for a moment.]

DANIEL, carrying on, with eyes on the new arrival: Evidently.

[CLARA looks up but does not move from the chair until an unamused RAHADIN tips them out of it with teapot-like disregard.]

CLARA: No luck?

[RAHADIN’S lips twitch in annoyance. He does not respond. Instead, he lights the oil lamp stage left. CLARA dusts themself off and springs to their feet.]

CLARA: It’s not that we don’t sympathize—

DANIEL: But the master’s tools cannot dismantle the master’s house.

CLARA: Especially if wielded by another set of instruments.

DANIEL: I think we’re confusing the metaphor too much. [beat] Would you say I’m more of a clarinet or a violin?

CLARA: Oboe.

[DANIEL nods.]

RAHADIN, finally losing his patience: Get out!

[With the practiced ease of career stagehands, CLARA sweeps up the prop cards - and pulls a handful of cards out of DANIEL’S sleeves with a disgusted look.]

[Both EXEUNT. The light remains on RAHADIN as he sits down to work for several minutes before flickering off.]
