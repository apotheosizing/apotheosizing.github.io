# Act 1, Scene 7: Exit Stage Left

DANIEL: Of course, our adventurers were able to defeat the witches of Bonegrinder. However, at the end of the fight, IREENA mysteriously collapsed. She had taken a few hits during the fight but nothing that should have caused such harm. Puzzled, the party decided that it would be best to return to Krezk to seek THE ABBOT's assistance.

Their journey first took them to Vallaki, as the dress THE ABBOT had requested was waiting there. Along the way, they were briefly waylaid by a will-o-wisp. It took to another of the many ruined towers that dotted Barovia's forests, though it neither led them to danger nor anything of value.

Just east of the town, the party encountered EVA. They sought her expertise on the matter of IREENA and she suggested immersing her in the lake near the Shrine of the Sun in Krezk. She emphasized that there was no guarantee that it would work but those waters had long ago been blessed by a saint and still held much of their power. She also managed to wheedle information about the party's goal of finding BABA YAGA, which she cautioned them against based on her own experiences.

The adventurers rested at the rooms they had paid for in advance at the Blue Water Inn for the night before heading to see FIONA WACHTER in the morning. Their hangers-on remained at the inn to look after IREENA.

Wachterhaus was the nicest residence the party had seen in Barovia but housed perhaps one of its most outwardly malevolent individuals. WACHTER demanded payment in the form of assassinating the burgomaster in exchange for the dress, though she settled for BARNABUS' fine spyglass. Her daughter, STELLA, led them out of the house before making a request of her own.

In her eyes, both FIONA WACHTER and VARGAS VALLAKOVICH were poorly suited as burgomaster. IZEK, though he was purportedly rather hard-nosed, at least cared about the people of Vallaki. She asked for them to assist him, but CONSTANTIN was adamantly against even considering IZEK due to his treatment of WREN.

While the party came to no conclusion on the matter, they did come across SASHA, who was willing to talk to them about VICTOR. They said that STELLA and VICTOR had had a falling out not long before his disappearance, fuelled the pressure from their parents to make good on their arranged engagement. When the party made it clear they were searching for him, SASHA asked to accompany them.

CLARA, with a touch of annoyance: And they said yes, of course, because these people don't know how to say no!

DANIEL, fighting back a laugh: Ahem. So, they departed for Krezk in short order. Their journey was entirely uneventful, with not even the caw of a raven to disturb them. They made their way immediately to the Tser Pool.

ROSAI laid IREENA in the waters and cast lesser restoration on her. A strange force flowed through the cleric and when IREENA opened her eyes, someone unfamiliar was looking out of them.

TATYANA MITU blinked up in confusion at the group of strangers around her and demanded to know what was going on. WREN asked several pointed questions about what she remembered, referencing SERGEI once more and a wedding between him and TATYANA. She only remembered the night before the incident and the revelation that those events had happened hundreds of years ago sent her into a state of shock.

The adventurers were frankly uncertain how to deal with her and KAI in particular was angered by the implication that IREENA was now lost forever. They had few options aside from bringing her along with them to the abbey in the hopes that THE ABBOT might be able to shed some light on this curious reincarnation.
