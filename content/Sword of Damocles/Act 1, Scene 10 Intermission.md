# Act 1 Intermission

[Heavenly music winds its way through Castle Ravenloft. STRAHD VON ZAROVICH sits before the organ, playing a song his father taught him in his youth in CÃ¢mpulung. CLARA and DANIEL sit on plain wooden chairs behind him. They are listening intently and do not look away even as they speak amongst themselves.]

CLARA: What do you think of music, Daniel?

DANIEL: Not much.

CLARA: As in, you don't think of it often or you don't think of it in esteem?

DANIEL: Both.

CLARA: I see. [after a beat] My brother was a pianist.

DANIEL: A brother? This is the first I've heard of it.

CLARA: Our parents tried to convince us both to take it up. He was the better of us. Less malleable, I think.

DANIEL: Mm.

CLARA: So, they found the amulet. I wonder if it will avail them.

DANIEL: We're the audience this time, Clara. You don't have to pose useless hypotheticals.

CLARA: Ha! Shows what you know. All the audience does is pose hypotheticals. That's the whole point of watching a performance.

DANIEL: I don't know... I think that we pose the hypotheticals to them.

[CLARA is silent. STRAHD finishes his piece and stands. He sweeps from the room with barely a glance at the extras. DANIEL rises from their seat.]

DANIEL: I suppose that's our cue. There will be hell to pay if we get caught loafing on the job.

CLARA, as if startled from a reverie: Hm? Ah. Yes. Shall we be about it?

DANIEL: Always.

[Both exeunt but the stage light remains on.]
