# Act 1, Scene 2: The Town of Barovia

DANIEL: I told them what I always tell new arrivals; I lied and said that their actions would matter. Though it wasn't all untrue, I guess, since there certainly will be people hurt by their action or inaction.

Once I'd recited my lines, they recited theirs, asking me the usual questions about where they were. I answered as much as I was allowed.

[CLARA'S eyebrows shoot up at their admission.]

Don't give me that look. After that, I left and they began the walk down the hill into the town.

CLARA: And that's where I met them. BARNABUS wanted to speak to a messenger about the letter he had been sent but I was not of much help.

When they passed by the doors of the Blood on the Vine tavern, they witnessed IREENA (who had left earlier with EZMERELDA) and ISMARK being expelled for disturbing the patrons with their quarrelling.

In recognition of their efforts to exorcise the GHOST, he invited them for dinner at the burgomaster's residence. It was notably not the house on the hill.

With the exception of WREN, the adventurers joined the Kolyans at their dining room table. ISMARK likewise answered their questions about Barovia, explaining that the land was under the unyielding fist of its count, the vampire STRAHD VON ZAROVICH. He knew little of the three outsiders' family members, as no one had come to Barovia for decades.

Inconveniently, CONSTANTIN remembered at this moment IREENA'S fate as related by his father. ISMARK reacted poorly to what he saw as a threat and asked the group to leave his home.

They reconvened with WREN outside and discussed their options. Since there was some doubt about whether or not the outsiders would find who they were looking for, they were content to follow CONSTANTIN back to the abbey in Krezk.

The hour was late, however, and wisdom meant that the five would remain in the village of Barovia for the night. CONSTANTIN suggested they ask the guidance of EVA KOPE before they sought refuge for the evening and the others had little reason to object.

EVA was not surprised by their appearance and welcomed them to stay the night in her camp. As she always did for newcomers to Barovia, she read their fortunes in the Tarroka deck.

EVA: This card reveals the hiding place of knowledge of your enemy. A faceless god awaits you at the end of a long and winding road, deep in the mountains.

Your next card tells of a great force to aid you. Look for a den of wolves in the hills overlooking a mountain lake. The treasure belongs to Mother Night.

This card belies a weapon of vengeance. I see a sleeping prince, a servant of light. It lies with him.

And lastly, the hour of your conflict with the Count is already proscribed. He shall be found with the one whose blood sealed his doom.

CLARA: The five stayed the night, though not together. WREN'S mother, ELODIA, disturbed the sleep of all those in the camp with her usual shrieking in the night but WREN had no compuctions about relocating further away from the others. Of course, he also declined to explain her presence to his companions.

In the morning, an unexpected visitor arrived at camp. IREENA insisted on accompanying the adventurers in the hopes of finding out what exactly was going on. [ASIDE: No doubt CONSTANTIN'S mention of her fate had kept her up most of the previous night.] EVA furnished her with a sword and bid the group farewell.

On their journey, the group had little else to do but talk. ROSAI and CONSTANTIN found kinship in their shared history of battling monsters while KAI and IREENA awkwardly discussed the matter of parents. WREN and BARNABUS were comic relief.

As they neared the western gate of Castle Ravenloft, a carriage approached them from a parallel path up the mountains. WREN, confident in the fact that it had been so many times, suggested they leave it alone since it was always empty.

Not so this time, as STRAHD stepped out of the carriage to observe the new arrivals to his domain. The conversation was tense but brief, the vampire apparently content simply to take their measure before allowing them right of way down the main road.

As they quickened their pace of travel, they speculated on his motives but ultimately decided it was not worth it to dwell on the matter.

DANIEL: That sounds unwise of them.

CLARA, nodding: Very.
