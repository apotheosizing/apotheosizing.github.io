# Act 1, Scene 5: By Dark of Night

DANIEL: In Krezk proper, the adventurers made their way to the home of the burgomaster. His wife, ANNA KREZKOVA, received them and made a request. In the last several days, items had been reported missing by every household in the village but aside from the party themselves, no one had traveled to Krezk of late.

They agreed to assist and so they went from door-to-door speaking with the residents of the town. Each theft had occurred in the dead of night, meaning the people they interviewed had little to share, but the area surrounding the scene of the crime held small clues in each case. Black strands of hair and claw marks led CONSTANTIN to conclude that they were dealing with a werewolf.

CLARA, butting in: They were also *very* rude about my performance as NICOLAE. As if there's any meat on those bones.

DANIEL, ignoring them: However, even if they had answered the question of who was responeible, they had no inkling as to why. The stolen items were not particularly valueable as fenced goods, being family trinkets and heirlooms. Nevertheless, they had not been asked to discover a motive, merely a culprit.

Rumour held that a den of werewolves could be found somewhere in the Svalich Wood and the people of Krezk in particular were concerned about venturing beyond their walls for that reason, but the forest stretched all the way to the foot of Mount Baratok in the north. Searching it blindly would take many, many hours. Fortunately, the adventurers did not have to do so. WREN was familiar enough with the area due to the presence of his horses to lead them to a suspected location and, lo and behold, they found a cave lit by torchlight in the side of one of the lower-lying hills.

The cave was nearly barren, holding only a few crates of living supplies and a fire around which a half a dozen wolves were sleeping. The party was able to sneak past them without waking the animals and proceed into the only chamber of note.

An altar had been erected to Mother Night at the back of the cave, laden with trinkets - the stolen items from Krezk among them. A woman was praying before the altar. BARNABUS spotted a particularly interesting prize seated in the statue's outstretched palm and immediately set about taking it while the woman was distracted by his companions.

ZULEIKA did not protest the party's accusation of theft, instead seeking to explain herself. So the legends said, STRAHD was Mother Night's creature and ZULEIKA had taken these items as offerings for an appeal for Krezk's protection. The adventurers recognized her desire to help but disagreed with her methods, pointing out that the stolen items held sentimental value to the people she'd taken them from. That, of course, had been the reason she'd stolen them, but ZULEIKA admitted that she had indeed done wrong, even if it was in pursuit of something good.

While BARNABUS was in the process of taking the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, ZULEIKA explained that she could bot return the offerings, as they belonged now to Mother Night. Any who took from the altar before had been stricken down for their tresspass. BARNABUS immediately put the amulet back upon hearing this but the damage had already been done - not that he knew that.

After some discussion, the party proposed that she at least admit what she had done to the others in Krezk. ZULEIKA agreed, though she requested the party's help. Her only other recourse was to seek out BAGA YAGA, the witch who was supposedly the daughter of Mother Night. She had not done so before due to the simply danger of the task but the adventurers were clearly capable enough to survive Barovia's worst. The party was willing to escort her after Krezk had their say on her fate.

On their return, the adventurers called all the residents of the village to a meeting, where ZULEIKA explained her actions. Her neighbours were stunned by this revelation and called for an hour's recess to discuss what should be done. Standing on the outskirts of the meeting, the party noticed that STRAHD was once again blithely present in one of his towns, apparently causing no alarm with his appearance.

CONSTANTIN, to their companions' relief no longer under his spell by this time, attempted to speak with him but he claimed they were mistaken and that he was in fact a man named Vasile.

There was nothing to do but to wait for Krezk's verdict and so the party returned to the abbey. THE ABBOT greeted them briefly before heading out for his own business, leaving ROSAI to look after the abbey in his absence.

The party - save WREN - took the opportunity to take stock of their situation. BARNABUS and ROSAI, CONSTANTIN and DARIUS, and KAI and IREENA all discussed the day's events to some extent, each pair reaching their own conclusions.
