# Act 1, Scene 3: All is Not Well

DANIEL: As they passed Lake Zarovich, BARNABUS spotted a lonely rowboat on the water, to all appearances—

CLARA, abruptly: There we go seamlessly switching off again. Are we really so interchangeable?

DANIEL, reflexively: What?

CLARA: Never mind.

DANIEL: — To all appearances abandoned. They decided that it merited a look and BARNABUS and ELODIA flew over to investigate. BARNABUS attempted to open the basket which was the only visible thing onboard and was summarily attacked by a ghost.

Rather than possessing him, the ghost took control of the rowboat and placed it on a collision course with the shore in the hope of killing the adventurers. Fortunately, they were able to splinter the boat before much damage was done and kill the ghost shortly thereafter.

The basket contained a ring of keys which held magic but their purpose was otherwise indiscernable. The group decided that it would behoove them to have the key ring and a spyglass BARNABUS had uncovered nearby identified. CONSTANTIN suggested they seek out VICTOR VALLAKOVICH in the nearby town of Vallaki, though they knew of the man little beyond what their father had mentioned of his exploits many years ago.

The guards at the gate were reluctant to let them in, particularly with WREN in their company, but they were eventually convinced to allow them to pass. The group's first stop was the stockyard, where the proprietor engaged in such steep price gouging that they could barely afford a dagger. WREN took on a dread form that frightened the woman half to death and allowed the party to take whatever they wished (though they did pay what they though the item should be worth, at the very least). CONSTANTIN did some damage control within the shop while the rest went outside to examine the wagon parked behind it.

From its dilapidated appearance, it was obvious that it had been sitting behind the stockyard for months, though the words "Rictavio's Carnival of Wonders" were still barely visible painted on the side. BARNABUS ran afoul of a poison needle trap picking the lock to the wagon just as CONSTANTIN returned to chew out WREN, causing WREN to leave and IREENA to go after him.

The wagon was empty, aside from a secret compartment containing a stash of items that better suited a Night Hunter than a carnival ringmaster. Given their purpose in Barovia, the party divided the items amongst themselves.

The group reconvened in the town square, where they hoped to learn of VICTOR'S whereabouts. He had two known associates in the form of STELLA WACHTER and SASHA ALEXEYEVSKOYE. Both were reluctantly preparing for the burgomaster's weekly festival when they were approached by the party. They informed them that VICTOR had been holed up in his attic for weeks now and neither of them had been able to convince him to leave. Before the adventurers could put that knowledge to use, IZEK STRAZNI - bodyguard and professional bully - took exception to WREN'S presence.

WREN escaped town atop his horse Moonshine, which defused the situation enough that IZEK was willing to leave the others be to pursue the spy of STRAHD. Ironically, the man himself arrived in the town square shortly after, seemingly amused by the trappings of the festival. The party slipped away from the plaza to the burgomaster's house, where they were immediately roped by the baroness into preparing for the festival. They were able to convince her to allow them to attempt to speak with VICTOR, though she only did so in exchange for their agreement to haul several boxes around the town.

The attic was guarded by a gylph of warding that did quite a number on CONSTANTIN but otherwise was completely empty. The baroness was utterly unconcerned with the adventurer's report of her son being missing, insisting that he must be hiding somewhere. KAI took exception to this but was talked down into completing the baroness' task by his companions.

Outside the limits of Vallaki, IREENA and BARNABUS both were able to find WREN. He was laying in a conspicuous and freshly-dug grave and bemoaning his lot in life. The pair kept him company and both were present when STRAHD appeared. He informed WREN that he had been thinking and perhaps had remembered the cartwright's son at last. The mere mention of his father threw WREN into a murderous rage that only amused STRAHD. The lord of Barovia departed amicably, apparently having no other purpose in his visit than taunting WREN.

With their manual labour complete, the other three headed to the edge of town to meet up with their allies. All in all, they decided that Vallaki had been a rather unproductive stop on their way to Krezk and that they would depart once more after taking a short rest. The suggestion of visiting the nearby and rather wizardly tower on the lake in the hope that they could get the assistance of someone familiar with identifying magic items was bandied about but no conclusive decision was made before they left.
