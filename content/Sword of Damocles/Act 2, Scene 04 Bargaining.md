# Act 2, Scene 4: Bargaining

DANIEL: The golem quickly proved itself to be a problem, as it was unaffected by non-magical attacks, effectively leaving the party down one fighter. While the others dealt with the golem, KAI worked on opening the southern doors.

Not long after he had successfully crowbarred them open, his companions shattered the golem, allowing them to have their run of the treasury. Between weighty piles of coin and piles of useless junk, the party was able to find a few items of real value and a tidy sum of silver that would more than cover any future costs. The exit led to the lower level of the main hall and the foot of the faceless statue.

Recalling EVA'S words, the adventurers spoke with the arcanaloth who currently occupied the statue and requested the journal that he possessed. The arcanaloth was surprised to find that he indeed had the book, which one would think might be a point of questioning for our heroes, but they simply read the opening words of the journal without further discussion.

Across the first several pages, STRAHD had written an abridged account of his history, apparently to preserve it in the event he was no longer able to remember it. Many of the details he described were known to the party thanks to TATYANA but there were several pieces of information she had not been privy to. Perhaps most interesting to the party was the information that TATYANA had been responsible for killing STRAHD after the murder of SERGEI, though it had cost her life to do so.

The moment they finished reading, the arcanaloth snapped the book shut and demanded that, if they were to take the book and delve further into its secrets, he would require sufficient incentive to part with it. He had his eye on several volumes in the collection at Castle Ravenloft and indicated that they would be his price. The party agreed, as they had a suspicion that EVA'S other clues would lead them to the castle sooner or later.

In quick succession, two familiar faces arrived at the temple. One was EZMERELDA, who found herself unclear on why exactly she had not offered to assist the party prior, but having resolved any doubts pledged to aid them in their siege on Ravenloft. The other was KASIMIR, who had uncovered little of use in the ruins of Berez and was unceremoniously assigned to WREN'S project by his sister once he had reported as much to her.

After a short rest in the library, the adventurers set about exploring the lower level and examining the various obelisks hidden away below the earth.

CLARA, amused: Those are always a crowdpleaser, aren't they?

DANIEL: As they examined the gifts on offer, THADDEUS noticed that one of the obelisks had been cracked open. He could draw no conclusions about what had transpired but he took one of its fragments in the event it proved somehow useful.

THADDEUS was also the only member of the party to accept a boon from the obelisk, though its nature was different than he'd assumed it would be prior to accepting. Rather than bolstering his intellect, he found his mind grew difficult to read. In exchange, he found his eyes taken from their sockets. Strangely, this had no effect on his vision, aside from making him unable to close his eyes.

As they approached the southern mausoleum, ROSAI noticed TATYANA'S deteriorating condition and was shocked to see that she appeared to be growing undead in nature. The party immediately concluded that she had lied about accepting the gift of resurrection and TATYANA admitted to having done so, with the concept of reviving IREENA on her mind. She felt that it was unfair that she, who had lived many times before, was allowed to live while IREENA had to die, but she was uncertain if she was ready to return to death once more.

The adventurers were ill at ease with this revelation but they had no way to undo the choice TATYANA had made to accept the obeliskâ€™s power. And so they continued on.
