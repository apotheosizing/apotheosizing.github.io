# Act 3 Intermission

[Again as silhouettes behind a thick red curtain, CLARA and DANIEL flit about, each hard at work. With both hands, CLARA is pushing a large marble coffin along a track that is just barely hidden by the facade stone of the stage floor. DANIEL is unhooking the metal apparatus of the portcullis from the painted wall.]

CLARA
[pantomiming wiping their forehead] Another successful performance. Our audience looked pleased tonight.

DANIEL
[walking with an exaggerated gait to place the various disassembled props out of sight] Did they? I couldn't see their faces through the worklights.

CLARA
Honestly? I don't know. It's just wishful thinking.

[Silence as the two work, until- ]

DANIEL
[suddenly circumspect] I wonder if we did the right thing.

CLARA
What?

DANIEL
I wonder if we did the right thing. They won't have our help from now on and they barely understand-

CLARA
[firmly] That will be their greatest asset. They aren't stuck in their ways. Literally, now.

[DANIEL nods.]

DANIEL
I wonder if we'll see them again.

CLARA
[stopping their work altogether] You know we won't.

[CLARA sits down, leaning against the edge of the coffin. Almost imperceptibly, they are shaking. Or is the the curtain moving? After a few moments, DANIEL notices and joins them, slumped against the other vertex of the prop.]

DANIEL
[with the attitude of someone changing the subject but unable to avoid it entirely] I'll miss Thaddeus.

CLARA
Me too. [beat] Isn't that awful?

DANIEL
[sighing and laughing] Dreadful.

CLARA
I hope our replacements know what they're doing.

DANIEL
I hope they don't.

[CLARA elbows DANIEL, prompting a noise of offense and then a laugh. Inch by inch, the curtains begin to part. When they are pulled back from the center of the stage, there is no one on it.]
