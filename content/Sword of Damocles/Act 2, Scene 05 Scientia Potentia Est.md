# Act 2, Scene 5: Scientia Potentia Est

CLARA: After sampling the many offerings of the Amber Temple, the party sought the opportunity to recuperate. As they passed by the central statue, the idea of asking the arcanaloth to part with the Tome for only a few days while they transcribed its contents was suggested.

WREN, pressing on PATRINA’S mastery of the Amber Temple, conveyed the suggestion to the arcanaloth. He was obviously displeased by the suggestion but could not find a sufficient counterargument when he would be allowed to keep the all-important original. There was no shortage of grumbling as he handed the book ober to the adventurers’ temporary keeping.

Transcribing a lengthy book was no mean feat, even with both WREN and THADDEUS offerering to share the task. THADDEUS estimated that it would require at least three days to complete.

That night, when even the transcribers had just begun to rest their heads, a booming sound echoed through the temple. A curious ROSAI, WREN, and THADDEUS went to investigate. RAHADIN had thrown wide the gates of the Amber Temple and reached the grand staircase by the time the adventurers reached him. He did not appear immediately hostile, prompting the party to question him.

RAHADIN told them he had come here to pray for STRAHD. Though he was a self-proclaimed enemy of PATRINA, neither KASIMIR nor the lich herself were bothered by his presence. Most of the party lost interest in him, though ROSAI spoke with him further, trying to ascertain what he knew of the cycles PATRINA had explained to them. He was not especially forthcoming, though he indicated that he and the party wanted the same thing.

Back in the library, WREN explained what he knew of RAHADIN to TATYANA, who remembered him being much less strange. Some time after TATYANA’S death, he had killed all of Barovia’s dusk elves at STRAHD’S command, leaving only himself and KASIMIR alive. KASIMIR said that he was spared only as some form of punishment, though he did not elaborate on what that punishment was for.

Over the next few days, the party deliberated on their next move. They had reason to presume that the weapon they sought would be found in SERGEI’S tomb and WREN surmised it must be within the castle, as he had never seen it before in all of his travels. TATYANA agreed, remembering the castle’s mausoleum from her time there. The adventurers agreed that they were not yet prepared to brave Castle Ravenloft.

However, they recalled the request of the revenant they had encountered. Argynvostholt was three hours journey from the temple and Berez - in which PATRINA had a continuing interest - was nearby. Once the tome was copied, the party set out across the Tsolenka pass.

Again, they found someone waiting for them upon the bridge. Astride his nightmare, STRAHD greeted them. They traded barbs briefly before making to depart. The party was assured by PATRINA’S statement that he would not wish to kill them in the hope of prolonging the cycle, but we all have our roles to play. Only one of the outsiders needed to live for things to continue.

A spell cracked the bridge in two, despite both THADDEUS and WREN’S efforts to block it. ROSAI was the first to fall. Her horse tumbled into the valley below but THADDEUS was able to manipulate gravity to catch her. The rest of the adventurers were just barely able to scramble out of danger.

It seemed that they would be forced to find an alternate path down the mountain until KASIMIR replaced the broken bridge with thinner but stable slabs of magical stone. Nothing further troubled them on their path to Argynvostholt.
