# Act 1, Scene 1: The House of Lament

[DANIEL moves backstage, where CLARA is seated atop a wooden crate, annotating a comically large stack of papers.]

CLARA: So?

DANIEL: So what?

CLARA: How was our premiere?

DANIEL: The curtain rose on a crossroads [ASIDE: on the full moon, of course] where three strangers converge. Each of them witnessed a curious event: a cloaked figure took flight, revealing leathery wings. When they took note of each other, the three inquired what the others were doing on this little-travelled road. They were surprised to learn that they had all received letters from a family member requesting their presence at the house atop the hill.

Now, of course, they thought it very unlikely that their loved ones were *all* in this house but each was certain that *theirs* would be found there. They decided to travel the remainder of the distance together.

When they arrived at the House of Lament, someone was indeed waiting for them. A man with white hair and antlers who matched the description of none of the individuals the three had come to meet.

[CLARA suppresses a laugh but settles for muttering something sardonic under their breath.]

DANIEL: He brought them through the doors of the estate to find the final member of their wayward group - a Night Hunter who asked skeptically if the four of them were there to hunt the ghost as well.

The conversation soon devolved into chaotic confusion put on hold by the eventual decision that they would be better of talking things over when they were out of the danger CONSTANTIN suggested they were all in by the presence of a violent ghost. They walked forward into a s√©ance room where IREENA was investigating (against her brother's wishes).

She was accompanied by EZMERELDA, whose appearance gave CONSTANTIN quite a shock, seeing as his mother had died when he was a child. She did not recognize him and was reluctant to believe his claims that she was his parent.

CLARA: Isn't it a bit much to introduce so many characters in so short a time?

DANIEL: [shrugs] It's efficient.

After some further confusion and indecision, KAI stepped out into the hall and made the decision for the rest of them that they would be moving forward. As they explored the house, it became clear that despite sharing the layout of the burgomaster of Barovia's home, IREENA did not recognize any of its contents. BARNABUS pointed out the portraits on the walls, which represented the Halvhrest family rather than the Kolyans.

Various signs of ghostly activity plagued the group as they explored the house, mostly serving to irritate rather than harm. The most severe of these came when CONSTANTIN, BARNABUS, KAI, and ROSAI were trapped in the master bedroom. After WREN made a comment about hurrying it up, they began to slowly suffocate until they were able to determine that they needed to burn the will on the desk in order to escape - something that WREN seemed to know was necessary.

As distrust grew between them, the group split up among the remaining rooms upstairs and downstairs. BARNABUS spent time examining the chimneys for hidden passageways and ended up on the roof where he saw THE MISTS OF BAROVIA choking the skies, though only minutes before the group had been able to see out of the windows of the conservatory.

Slowly, the group pieced together that each of the Halvhrests had met their deaths at the hands of some bitter assailant. Whether that person was the ghost who inhabited these halls or if they were one of their victims remained unclear until they reached the small tower at the west of the house.

Ancient flagstones gave way to a cavern beneath the house that had been sealed off by a poor work of carpentry. An amber stone stood at its center, whispering to those who came into contact with it. KHIRAD, THE STAR OF SECRETS, heralded the manifestation of the GHOST as the adventurers approached the site where she had made the decision to kill her own family.

The GHOST possessed BARNABUS, who immediately set about cutting the rope that the adventurers had used to descend below the earth and flew away. Fortunately, they were able to fashion a makeshift grappling hook and slowly climb out of the pit to give chase. EZMERELDA was able to knock BARNABUS out before the GHOST could enact her plan to seal them in the cavern forever and ROSAI restored him from death's door to rejoin the ranks of the adventurers.

Hindered by their nonmagical weaponry, the battle with the GHOST was a drawn-out affair but the adventurers were able to destroy the GHOST and end the haunting before the night was over.

Still at the height of their triumph, they left the House of Lament and stepped into the land of Barovia. That was where I met them.
