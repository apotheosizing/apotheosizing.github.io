# Act 1, Scene 6: Things Unforetold

CLARA: Only WREN and CONSTANTIN returned to the town square to hear the pronouncement of ZULEIKA'S sentence, as ROSAI had agreed to remain at the abbey and there was no real reason for all of them to go to collect ZULEIKA. She informed them that she would be required to carry out several months of community service but that the burgomaster had agreed to allow her to search for BABA YAGA first.

THE ABBOT returned not long after the rest of the party, having managed to restore ILYA to life. BARNABUS, having realized that he could find no rest during their downtime, asked THE ABBOT to lift the curse. He agreed and took BARNABUS upstairs for a diagnosis and treatment.

While BARNABUS slumbered above, THE ABBOT made another request of the group. He had arranged with FIONA WACHTER of Vallaki to procure a wedding dress for VASILKA. It had been completed but the roads of Barovia were dangerous of late and he would not be able to retrieve it himself. The party agreed, though they were curious enough to ask to whom VASILKA was betrothed, and the revelation that it was to ISMARK caught them all by surprise.

Nonetheless, they assured THE ABBOT that they would pick it up on their way back to Krezk.

The matter of their destination was still unclear, until ZULEIKA informed them of what rumours claimed about BABA YAGA'S location. Stories said that she lived somewhere in the Svalich Wood, which was so broad a claim that it was essentially useless. However, a coven of witches supposedly lived in the Old Bonegrinder and it was possible that they knew more details.

The party set out as soon as BARNABUS woke. On their way to the abandoned mill, they came across a body laying face down in the middle of the road. The dead person resembled ROSAI, though they were not identical, and the evidence that someone may have been hunting her down and found the wrong person was disquieting.

Further along the path, they crossed paths with a revenant who proclaimed herself to be an enemy of STRAHD. The party identified themselves similarly and she told them to visit Argynvostholt and speak with her commander. DARIUS told the adventurers that the Order of the Silver Dragon had called their stronghold Argynhostholt and that legend held that they had been the only military force capable of standing against STRAHD during his invasion of Barovia.

The party decided investigating an old ruin could wait until they had concluded their business elsewhere. By this time, night was falling, so the travelers decided to stop in at the inn in Vallaki for a rest.

The Blue Water Inn had the dubious honour of being the only inn in the county but its accomodations were decent enough and they even had a bard performing that night - the modestly famous RUNE ROUNDEL. Despite being woken in the middle of the night by IREENA, who had been experiencing a nightmare - the contents of which she no longer remembered the next morning.

Having rested, the party set out for the Bonegrinder. The arms of the windmill were spinning, making it clear that someone was indeed present inside. Outside, ROSAI took note of a set of four carved stones thay depicted the paradisical cities of the gods and, bizarrely, some crumbs and teeth that had been left atop one of them.

The mill was being used by an elderly woman, MORGANTHA, for baking and her behaviour made it extremely obvious that she was cooking human body parts into her pastries. In order to get her to confess to the act, BARNABUS concocted a genius plan - 

DANIEL, right on cue: So genius that it didn't even remotely work!

CLARA: - and instead she simply confessed under the influence of a suggestion spell. Combat broke out soon thereafter between the adventurers and the witches of the Old Bonegrinder.

DANIEL: And it ended on a cliffhanger because we can't expect the audience to sit around quietly for more than four hours.
