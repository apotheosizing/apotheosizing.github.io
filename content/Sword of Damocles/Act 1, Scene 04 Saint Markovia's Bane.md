# Act 1, Scene 4: Saint Markovia's Bane

CLARA: After their rest, the group decided that they would indeed visit the tower on Lake Baratok. As they moved off the road onto a path that cut through the forest, they encountered a skeletal rider. It was travelling west on a parallel path with THE MISTS OF BAROVIA at its heels and while the others were content to ignore it, CONSTANTIN was not. They shot several crossbow bolts at it until it was out of sight. Fortunately for them, none of their shots landed.

The tower was remarkable only in its state of disrepair. BARNABUS flew up to one of the arrow slits to see if he could spot anyone inside. The arrow that was fired at him confirmed that someone was - EZMERELDA. She questioned the group's presence in a place so far off the main road but she was willing to assist them by identifying the items.

After a *shocking* incident with a trap placed on the door, EZMERELDA allowed them into the tower. As it was strictly speaking habitable, the party requested an hour's rest. With her business there concluded, EZMERELDA saw no reason to object.

CONSTANTIN took the opportunity to speak with her about VAN RICHTEN, her mentor and the former resident of the tower. It was a pleasant enough conversation, though she again took exception to his claim that she was his mother.

Once the items were identified, the six travellers took their leave. Krezk was only an hour away, meaning they would arrive well before dusk if they kept their pace.

Like Vallaki, its walls were patrolled by a small contingent of guards. Unlike Vallaki, they were allowed in with a minimal amount of hassle. One guard informed CONSTANTIN that the town was in mourning for the evening. The burgomaster's son ILYA had sucumbed to his illness and though the burgomaster had petitioned THE ABBOT for intervention, he had been ignored.

This news was surprising, as the abbey in Krezk had not had an abbot in CONSTANTIN'S memory and ILYA KREZKOV was the burgomaster of Krezk, not his son, so far as they aware. As such, they were keen to return to the abbey presently.

ROSAI requested a short detour to the Shine of the White Sun near the Tser Pool at the north edge of town. She was hoping for find guidance there, or at least a moment of solace.

The shrine was little more than a statue of the Morninglord, surrounded by small offerings had been left by worshippers. ROSAI and CONSTANTIN took a few moments to pray and then began to depart for the abbey.

As they passed the Tser Pool, the group caught sight of a familiar man. STRAHD was kneeling at the edge of the water, staring into it intently. He gave no indication that he had seen the party and most were content to take advantage of his distraction to flee. CONSTANTIN, however, under the influence of his vestige, was not. He attempted to attack STRAHD but the strike did not land true and he was quickly placed under STRAHD'S charm.

The others could do little but watch in horror as their companion was drained of blood. Indeed, CONSTANTIN would have here met his end were it not for WREN'S intervention. He shouted that SERGEI would not want him to do this here. Whether that was true or not, STRAHD hesitated, just for a moment, just long enough for KAI to take CONSTANTIN and run.

The party raced to the abbey, not daring to even glance behind them. At its gates, they encountered DARIUS DRACUL TRADAT, who seemed to know CONSTANTIN and immediately offered his assistance to the party.

BARNABUS was able to unlock the gate and the group filed in. DARIUS, being a familiar with the abbey, directed them to an unlocked shed where some of them could wait CONSTANTIN while the others sought out THE ABBOT.

They found him in the abbey's main hall, in the midst of conversation with VASILKA. WREN remainded to speak with her while the others brought THE ABBOT to CONSTANTIN.

He was able to prevent CONSTANTIN from bleeding out and restore their strength, but he was unable to break the charm that STRAHD had placed on him. However, he extended the hospitality of the abbey to the adventurers for the evening, which they gratefully accepted.

ROSAI, relieved to finally find someone kind and trustworthy, spoke with THE ABBOT for a time. He told her the tale of SAINT MARKOVIA - for whom the abbey was named - and discussed the abbey's worsening relationship with Krezk. She suggested that he might win back their regard by restoring ILYA to life and THE ABBOT agreed to try in the morning. He asked ROSAI to watch over the abbey in his absence.

The rest of the night was uneventful. CONSTANTIN'S charm had not faded by morning and the group spent several minutes convincing him not to run offin search of STRAHD. They could not dissuade him from leaving the abbey entirely though and ROSAI requested that THE ABBOT delay his visit to the town for a time so that she could ensure CONSTANTIN'S safety. He agreed to do so, allowing the entire party to head down to the town together.
