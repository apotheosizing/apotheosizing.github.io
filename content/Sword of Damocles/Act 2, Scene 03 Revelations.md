# Act 2, Scene 3: Revelations

CLARA: CONSTANTIN rapidly reconsidered their intention to fight the dullahan and the horse and its rider thundered past, crossing the bridge and heading down into the foothills of Mount Ghakis.

The cold turned bitter as the party ascended the path to the Amber Temple. Its faceless sentinels called to mind part of EVA'S prophecy and WREN led the way inside with the confidence of a man who had done so a hundred times. Indeed, it became increasingly obvious that he was familiar with the temple and it with him when the guardian within the massive statue in the entrance hall halted their attack when he confirmed his identity.

WREN led them down the hallways without so much as a pause until he reached his destination. There were a few amusing slapstick gags involving a hypnotic statue and a mountainnof skulls that were interrupted by the entrance of PATRINA VELIKOVA.

She exchanged a few words with WREN before dispelling the magic that had ensnared CONSTANTIN and inviting the party into her study.

CONSTANTIN knew her name from his father's adventurers and demanded proof that she was trustworthy before their discussion went any further. She had no conclusive proof to provide but WREN'S trust was deemed sufficient for the time being.

PATRINA explained to the party the true nature of their situation. CONSTANTIN and WREN - who both knew things they should not have - had not traveled back in time, but rather they had remained cognizant through circumstances that THADDEUS quickly realized described a time loop.

Strictly speaking, that was an incomplete understanding of the situation but it was effective enough for the adventurers' purposes. PATRINA told them that she had first become aware of it after her resurrection and death within the walls of Castle Ravenloft. She had worked tirelessly to make herself no longer a fitting choice for her role, instead taking the one originally held by Exethanter the lich and using her expanded time onstage to come to her current understanding.

The adventurers bombarded her with questions, not all of which she was willing or able to answer, but overall impressed upon them one simple fact - there was nothing they could do to circumvent the will of those that orchestrated the loop from within. Furthermore, she suggested that it was likely STRAHD would neither allow them to kill him nor would he kill them, as either situation would reset the playing field. This was a boon, though only for so long as they wanted to buy themselves time to address the loop itself.

WREN, who had heard this speech given to many a group and needed no time to process this information, asked for the item of prophecy that PATRINA possessed. She said that she would do so once they availed themselves of the temple.

PATRINA escorted the party out through a passageway to the nearby library and kept WREN back to inform him that her brother KASIMIR was in Berez and ask for him to look in on his progress if he happened to be in the area. Meanwhile, the party discussed what they had learned. CONSTANTIN was adamant about dismantling the loop but the outsiders wisely took PATRINA'S words to heart and knew there was nothing to be done about it for the time being.

Instead, they examined the library. The books were blank to the naked eye but ROSAI quickly realized that their words were concealed by a command word. The party tore as many books off the shelves as they could, finding several useful spells among the collection.

Once WREN had rejoined them, they descended to the lower level. Three amber obelisks had been erected there and TATYANA discovered that touching them allowed communion with BEINGS BEYOND THE REALM. Two of the three were not interested in the party but the last offered the power to restore the dead. ROSAI and TATYANA both claimed that they declined this power, though ROSAI had suspicions about TATYANA'S truthfulness.

A nearby crack in the wall revealed a path into the treasury. The room appeared unguarded until a statue came to life to oppose the presence of the intruders...
