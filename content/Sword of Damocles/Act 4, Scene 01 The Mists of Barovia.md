# Act 1, Scene 1: The Mists of Barovia

[Two extras sit backstage - DARIUS and LOUISE. LOUISE appears to be straightening a comically large horse head atop papier-mâché shoulders while DARIUS begins to recount the evening’s performance.] 

LOUISE: Our scene opens on a crossroads [ASIDE: on the full moon, of course] where three strangers converge. Each of them witnessed a curious event: a cloaked figure took flight, revealing leathery wings. When they took note of each other, the three inquired what the others were doing on this little-travelled road. They were surprised to learn that they had all received letters from a family member requesting their presence at the house atop the hill-

[Suddenly, an alarm blares. The two extras stop abruptly and abscond. For several minutes there is nothing to be seen on stage. Someone in the audience coughs, loudly. After a time, LOUISE returns to the stage, then DARIUS.]

DARIUS: Should we- ?

LOUISE: No. They’re not part of this, and by design. We’ll stay the course.

DARIUS, not entirely convinced: Alright.

LOUISE: Ahem. So, our three strangers entered the hilltop house, finding within a dilapidated structure that clearly had not been lived in for years. The first doubts about the veracity of their letters began to germinate but, as the door was firmly locked, they had no recourse but to explore the sprawling house in hopes of discovering a means of escape.

MIRIK was the first to notice the subtle rot afflicting the portraits of the Halvhrest family, not just the canvas but the subjects themselves. Phantom figures seemed to walk in the corners of eyes and footsteps creaked overhead despite all three members of the party being clustered together during their exploration.

They began their investigation in the basement - an unwise place to begin, as in the southwestern tower there lay an amber stone that called out to the adventurers. KHIRAD, THE STAR OF SECRETS and the GHOST that had been bound to it for all eternity chased the trio up from the cavern beneath the house until they reached the study. In a moment of carelessness, SARALA misfired a bolt of flame that ricocheted into the desk, where it burned the half-written will laid out upon it. As the paper burned, the GHOST faded into incorporeality until it could no longer harm them, destroying the last vestiges of the family grudges that had spelled the house’s sad fate.

Conveniently for them, this caused the front door to unlock, allowing them to leave, though they found themselves in an unfamiliar landscape. THE MISTS obscured the outline of a small town which had no resemblance to the crossroads on the approach to the house. The adventurers were deeply unsettled by their transmigration but had little choice but to head down into the town and learn what they could.

Being travelers, they gravitated toward the Blood of the Vine Tavern, where they encountered ISMARK KOLYANOVICH. He quickly directed them to EVA KOPE, though he requested that they return to Barovia as soon as they could after speaking with her, as he had a matter that he hoped they could help him with.

In a temporary camp to the west, our heroes met with EVA KOPE. She explained their circumstances - that this land was ruled over by the vampiric count STRAHD VON ZAROVICH and that, if they wished to survive to leave these cursed lands, they would have to kill the count before he did the same to them. With her powers of divination, she could point them in the direction of people and powers that could help them, though she could only do so one Tarokka card at a time-

DARIUS: What?

LOUISE, as though only just realizing what they said: I… hm. That’s not right.

DARIUS: Are those three…? What could they possibly be trying to accomplish?

LOUISE: It seems to me like a meaningless delay, but if what they need is *time*.

DARIUS, smacking their palm into their forehead: Time. Of course.

LOUISE, cautiously: So, should we be doing something about them?

DARIUS, dubiously: So long as they stay away from the play, there’s not much we can do. After all, like we told them, they’re not subject to our authority anymore.

LOUISE: We’ll have to step in eventually. Did you see where they were heading after their talk with EVA?

DARIUS: West, I think. To Vallaki. By now, though, they should be at van Richten’s tower with EZMERELDA.

LOUISE: And ruining our party’s meeting with her. Damn.

DARIUS: We can improvise. She’ll be back, and until she is, there’s the matter of ISMARK’S troubles to attend to.

LOUISE: I suppose. Let’s hope we know what we’re doing here.

DARIUS: And that *they* do.
