# Act 1, Scene 9: Yesteryear

DANIEL: The party descended into the cellar, where they encountered another druid. Things did not evolve into hostility, however, as they invoked Barta's name and said they were searching for the Seeds.

The cellar did not produce anything of value, though WREN and BARNABUS were briefly trapped in a mold-lined cavern behind the cellar and SASHA retrieved their peace offering for VICTOR and STELLA. Returning to the main floor, the party began searching the fermentation vats under the theory that a Seed may have been hidden there by the fleeing winemakers.

Barta suggested against searching two of them, which she had poisoned, and the third yielded nothing. As ROSAI spoke to Barta about the possibility of the druids leaving the winery to operate without the Seeds, BARNABUS turned his atttention to the well outside.

Between him and the well lay the sea of twig blights but the well itself was open to the air. BARNABUS was able to dive into the well from above and swim down to the bottom. He dislodged a small smooth stone from the wellspring and returned to the surface of the water. Weighed down by being wet, KAI and WREN had to extricate him by bringing a rope through the twig blight wall - which KAI did by simply running directly through them.

Once everyone was safely back inside the winery, BARNABUS examined the stone and determined that it was indeed magical. Further inspection by Barta confirmed it was a Seed. The party upheld the bargain they had made and gave it to the druids. In return, Barta informed them that BABA YAGA was currently atop Yester Hill to the south.

THE MISTS OF BAROVIA swirled thickly around Yester Hill, leeching from the forest to encircle the base of the hill. At its peak was the remnants of an old structure and a familiar figure stood at its centre, examining what appeared to be a statue of himself. STRAHD VON ZAROVICH greeted the party but was quickly interrupted by BARNABUS, who insisted that he had been bitten by STRAHD at the abbey. STRAHD pinned the blame squarely on WREN, much to the party's surprise.

Out in the distance, an expansive settlement was visible. It was difficult to make out much through THE MISTS but it was clearly no town of Barovian make. WREN recognized it as the city of CÃ¢mpulung, the capital of the kingdom of both his and STRAHD'S birth. STRAHD asked the party if they missed their homes. ROSAI did, though the other two outsiders remained quiet.

Over the crest of the hill, a gnarled and cracked tree was visible, as well as a hut. Knowing that it likely belonged to BABA YAGA, the adventurers brushed past STRAHD to knock on its door.

BABA YAGA invited them inside and asked them what had caused them to seek her out. ZULEIKA, ROSAI, and CONSTANTIN made their requests for intercession, which the old woman considered. She was willing to speak to Mother Night on their behalf in exchange for the Seeds. She had found one some time ago and used it to animate her hut. She coveted their power, though she did not have a plan for the other two yet. Having little choice, the party agreed and BABA YAGA sent them on their way, saying that her prayers required privacy.

STRAHD was gone by the time the party exited the hut but THE MISTS had grown tighter around the hill, blocking the path back toward the winery. The party decided it was best to wait it out and took the opportunity to rest at the top of the hill.

KAI broached the subject of WREN'S vampirism and WREN told the party what he knew, which was not much. He had never encountered another creature like himself and he was not even certain that he would be able to survive outside Barovia.

After an hour, THE MISTS had receeded enough that the party could safely travel away from Yester Hill. They stopped by the winery on their way back to Krezk in the hopes that they could negotiate with the druids for the Seed. The druids and their twig blights were nowhere to be found but the winemakers had returned. The patriarch of the family explained that they had seen all that had transpired from the rafters of the winery and requested the return of their Seed. The party could not do so, however, given their bargain with BABA YAGA.

He was not best pleased by their response, though he recognized there was no point in arguing with them. According to family folklore, the third Seed had been taken to Mount Baratok, though he could not substantiate the claim. As the party departed, he suggested they visit the Blue Water Inn next time they were in Vallaki, since it was owned by his family.

The journey to the cave where ZULEIKA'S shrine had been constructed was uneventful and no great wrath descended on the party as they retrieved the amulet. With one of the four prophecies fulfilled, the curtains closed on the first act.
