# Act 1, Scene 3: All is Not Well

LOUISE: Gaining entry to Wachterhaus proved to be a relatively simple matter. IREENA and ARHA conveyed the sad news of IREENA’S father’s death and FIONA WACHTER allowed them inside to offer her condolences and some personal advice, having suffered the loss of her husband in the past. MIRIK and SARALA excused themselves from the parlor with the claim of needing to refresh themselves and headed off into the upper floors and basement respectively.

On the upper balcony, in the process of tending to her chores, was STELLA WACHTER. The young heir took great exception to the sight of a stranger wandering around unaccompanied in her house, but MIRIK was able to talk her down by insisting that they were just lost. Still a touch annoyed, STELLA offered to help them find their way to the privy. As they walked, MIRIK did their best to gauge her attitude toward STRAHD and her willingness to assist them, as it was either her or VICTOR named in EVA KOPE’S prophecy.

STELLA was personally opposed to her mother’s obvious intention to curry favour with STRAHD, but she did not have much in the way of battle prowess to offer the party. MIRIK remained steadfast, however, and STELLA was cajoled into giving her agreement to help. According to rumour, THE ABBOT of the Abbey of Saint Markovia was able to furnish great blessings upon the people of the land, though he rarely did so for fear of provoking the wrath of the count upon Krezk. STELLA said that she might be of more use if she was imbued with the power of the last great rebel of Barovia.

Meanwhile, LADY WACHTER spoke with IREENA. A strict adherence to propriety prevented her from asking outright but it was obvious to anyone who was listening that WACHTER wanted to broker an alliance between herself and IREENA under the implication that they could each assist the other in their future roles as burgomasters. IREENA was not particularly enthusiastic to associate with WACHTER, given her known support of STRAHD, though for the sake of the ruse that had brought them here, she paid lip service to the idea.

Having sufficiently fluffed WACHTER’S ego beforehand, the group as a whole was able to persuade the noblewoman to allow her daughter to go with them, under the false pretense that they would be going to the village of Barovia.

Their acquisition of the ally they sought led SARALA to remind the party that they should return to EVA to receive the next part of their reading. Krezk was much closer than the campsite where EVA commonly lived which caused the adventurers to prioritize it as their destination.

Just as they got to the gates of the small community, they received a sending from EVA. [frowning] Wait… this isn’t supposed to—

[DARIUS comes in from the stage once more, looking horrified.]

DARIUS, in a hoarse whisper: The audience has taken notice of them.

[LOUISE stops dead. All their contrasting optimism that they would be able to deal with the problem of the additional adventurers is drained in an instant.]

LOUISE: And they escaped their notice?

DARIUS: Yes! I don’t even understand how, they stood in their presence and laughed in their faces. Not that they got away unscathed, but that they got away at all is—

LOUISE: Unthinkable. We need to speak with them. Where are they?

DARIUS: Ravenloft. With MORDENKAINEN and PATRINA added to their ranks.

LOUISE, disbelieving: PATRINA? Gods, I really underestimated them.

DARIUS, grasping at straws: At least, unlike the rest, she’s made no promise to help them.

LOUISE: Doesn’t matter. We need to go.

[THE EXTRAS run on stage, only to return minutes later, looking shaken to their very foundations. They are silent for long, long minutes.]

DARIUS: Will their plan work?

LOUISE: Are you really entertaining helping them?! We know what happened to CLARA and DANIEL.

DARIUS, with the smallest embers of conviction in their voice: CLARA and DANIEL were our friends, LOUISE. They would have wanted us to help.

LOUISE, suddenly shouting: *They* aren’t playing around anymore! Giving CLARA and DANIEL as much leeway as they did is not an oversight they’ll make again! What can we even do?

DARIUS, matching their volume: I don’t know! But we should do something, shouldn’t we?

LOUISE, quieter: I don’t know.

DARIUS: Well, I—

[There is a BOOM that shakes the backstage set. Props and backgrounds hanging on the walls crash to the ground. DARIUS and LOUISE, by their expressions, know what this means and are frightened beyond words. DARIUS throws back the red velvet curtains to expose an awful sight.

A great hand of smoke and fire smears itself across reality, digging its fingers into the ancient earth and stone of Castle Ravenloft. The audience makes their fury known - with a wrenching motion, there is upheaval. The stage itself cracks and strains and those upon it are tossed like boats in a storm. LOUISE and DARIUS look on.

Among the splinters of the stage, THADDEUS, ROSAI, and KAI mirror the positions of ARHA, SARALA, and MIRIK, with STRAHD between them. He turns to face the intruders, face blank.]

THE POWERS THAT BE: You have made your final mistake, interlopers.
