# Act 2, Scene 1: To the Quick

CLARA: Given their proximity to Mount Baratok, ZULEIKA, accompanied by DARIUS and SASHA took their leave of the group to search for the missing Seed of Arietis.

Having acquired quicker means of transportation, the adventurers swiftly returned to the abbey. Upon their arrival, they saw that the inner gate to the abbey itself had been blown off its hinges by an intense impact.

DANIEL: So, what news from our protagonists?

CLARA: Well... the adventurers parted ways with their Barovian allies in the woods, as the foot of Mount Ghakis was the ideal point to begin searching for the Seed of Arietis proported to have been taken to its peak. Having acquired quicker means of transportation, the five swiftly returned to the abbey. Upon their arrival, they saw that the inner gate to the abbey itself had been blown off its hinges by an intense impact.

In the main hall, the party found a shocking tableau. STRAHD had THE ABBOT in his grasp and was moments away from draining his life from his body. The party immediately sprung into action. STRAHD ignored their attacks almost entirely, fixated on the death of THE ABBOT. Only when the holy man was dead at his feet did STRAHD 

VASILKA, who had been attempting to assist TATYANA in fleeing from the abbey, descended the stairs to the grisly sight and stopped short, barely responding to the party's questioning. ROSAI hoped to learn of the location of any diamonds in Barovia that she might be able to use to restore THE ABBOT to life using the spell speak with dead, though she would have to wait until she had recovered her magical reserves to do so. WREN spoke with VASILKA, who admitted that though the nature of her relationship with THE ABBOT was a difficult one, she mourned his sudden loss. And, as there was no longer a secret to keep on the matter, she informed the party that she had never been intended to marry ISMARK but rather STRAHD. She also declared her intention to accompany the party on their journey.

After an uncomfortable night spent in the abbey, ROSAI learned from THE ABBOT that all the riches of Barovia had long been spent and there would be no hope of drawing new diamonds from the land. However, that did not preclude finding an existing diamond somewhere in the county. Doubting the safety of the abbey now that its guardian was dead and STRAHD was aware of their presence within it, the party made plans to head toward the Amber Temple to the south. They would need appropriate clothing for the journey, which could only be purchased in Vallaki, and so they resolved to depart posthaste.

The town was much as they had left it, though supporters of FIONA WACHTER had grown so bold as to advocate for the overthrow of Baron Vallakovich in the centre of town. IZEK eventually broke up the gathering, sending the people of the town and the adventurers who had stopped to consider what the scene meant for the tipping balance of power on their way. ROSAI and BARNABUS split off from the group to return to the Wachter estate - BARNABUS to steal back the spyglass he had been cheated out of by WACHTER and ROSAI to ensure he didn't die in the attempt.

A comedy of errors ensued, during which BARNABUS learned that it was a troublesome task to distract a dead body. The corpse of Nikolai Watcher was seated in his favourite armchair in the master bedroom, where his wife had placed the spyglass. BARNABUS, under the impression that a living person was in the room, repeatedly tried to rouse him from the chair by throwing rocks and eventually by crashing into the window of a different room. Unfortunately, this drew the attention of STELLA WACHTER, who chased the disguised BARNABUS out of the house.

Once the rest of the party had secured cold-weather clothing, they decided it would be best to spend a night at the Blue Water Inn. Given recent events, the party could use a moment of pleasant respite and, indeed, they found that the clientele of the inn was quite polite. The majority of the party commiserated with each other for the rest of the night but CONSTANTIN was surprised to see her mother walk through the doors of the establishment. She took the opportunity to catch EZMERELDA up on the recent developments among the party. EZMERELDA was sorry to hear of IREENA'S death but again took CONSTANTIN'S familiarity with her as almost an insult and left the bar without even finishing her drink.

The barkeep waived the fee for room and board for the party, having heard from "a little bird" that they had assisted his father. Thus, the party enjoyed a night in the inn's best rooms before setting forth on the path for the Amber Temple.
