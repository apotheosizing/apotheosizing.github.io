# Act 3, Scene 2: Reunion

CLARA: With no other safe options before them, the party made their way to the abandoned ruins of Berez. The turn toward marshlands slowed their approach on horseback, particularly when it became hazardous enough that they were forced to walk. However, they were able to make good time with KASIMIR in the lead.

The little town had obviously seen better days, as its fields were utterly barren and its homes destroyed and looted. It was an eerie sight, devoid of even wild animals. As the party began to circle into the center of town, however, a warning arrow struck into the ground by their feet.

Atop a nearby building, a figure stood sentinel. They were shortly joined by a small group of fighters that had split into two groups to move around the structure toward the intruders. Contrary to expectation, these were resilient fighters who demonstrated a surprising amount of skill for villagers. Nevertheless, the party had significant arcane firepower that decimated one of the two squads during their approach.

As the line of battle was joined, WREN climbed to the top of the building only to be met with a familiar face. The archer wore the very same mask as ROSAI. Putting two and two together, WREN drew her attention down toward her sister’s presence and effectively ended the battle. CHY’KIRA, as she introduced herself, mourned the unfortunate losses in the conflict but could not hold it against the adventurers. She invited them to come to the few buildings she and hers had secured to speak properly.

A couple dozen individuals occupied a sixth as many homes in a tight-knit group at the middle of Berez. They were an eclectic group and most were known to WREN from his many years of time in Barovia. CHY’KIRA interrogated the party on their motives and activities but was subject to little scrutiny in return, primarily as ROSAI was simply relieved to find her sister unharmed. CHY’KIRA appeared to be the de facto leader of the group, meaning she soon had to cut short their discussion to deal with various logistical matters. She invited the party to eat, rest, and move about the town at their leisure.

Given the recent events as Argynvostholt, the party was grateful for the safety and accepted immediately, having one of their most restful nights in this strange land since their arrival. WREN took several hours to sift through his memories of these “villagers”, concluding that he was indeed familiar with most of them as fallen members of previous adventuring groups to stand against STRAHD. KAI confessed to TATYANA that, though he was happy for ROSAI, he wasn’t sure if he wanted the letter that brought him to Barovia to likewise be genuine.

In the morning, the party examined the only two notable locations in Berez, an expansive residence likely once belonging to the burgomaster and the nearby church. Even in comparison to the destruction wrought on Berez, the burgomaster’s residence was notably ruined. Like Argynvostholt before it, there was evidence of the use of siege weaponry. Danger, too, lurked among the wreckage in the form of a lingering spirit of sorrow and fury that affected KAI and THADDEUS. Fortunately, removing them from the area was enough to break its hold.

The church had suffered the ravages of time, save for a silver bell that looked as pristine as the day it was forged. THADDEUS determined that it was infused with some manner of magic but was unable to identify a particular spell that might have been used - particularly given the length of time over which it had been preserved.

In the churchyard, at the end of the encroaching MISTS, another peculiarity sat in the form of a statue. The figure depicted was difficult to identify but they held a rose in their hand that intrigued the party. There was no dedication or inscription at the statue’s foot, leaving them to speculate fruitlessly until the time came to return to the inhabited areas of the town to reconvene with their fellow adventurers once again.
