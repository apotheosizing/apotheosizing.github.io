# Act 1, Scene 4: Peripiteia

[Spliters of the stage seem to almost threaten to get into the eyes of the rapt audience. The battle between these former heroes and THE POWERS THAT BE rips apart the theatre. It is obvious to any casual observer that this should be over in moments but something about THADDEUS, ROSAI, and KAI eludes the omnipotence of THE POWERS THAT BE.]

[Iteration through iteration, the trio and their gathered companions destroy THE POWERS THAT BE. Gravity warps and twists to no avail as THADDEUS enacts his plan. CONSTANTIN, WREN, CHY’KIRA SERGEI, and TATYANA are each pulled forth from the void and lend their assistance to the effort. PATRINA, BABA YAGA, EVA KOPE, NEFERON, and STRAHD, too, pour their power into the opposition.]

[The BLACK HOLE begins to crumble until it is gone, freeing a host of souls across time and compact space. As the last of their time together ticks down, the survivors make their amends to each other. Those who wish to go prepare to go while those who cannot or will not watch on. With a final wave of his hands, THADDEUS breaks the time loop. He and his companions are gone. The lights go down on PATRINA and STRAHD, who are just visible turning on their heels away from each other to move off-stage. After some modest applause, the audience files out on the unexpected final performance of Curse of Strahd.]

[When the stage is next illuminated, four extras are sitting on its edge. CLARA and DANIEL are eating ice cream from oversized waffle cones (chocolate and rocky road, respectively) while LOUISE and DARIUS take turns throwing popcorn into each other’s mouths. All appear, for the first time since their introduction, content.]

DARIUS: So… I’ve been meaning to ask.

CLARA and DANIEL: Mm?

LOUISE: How did you slip them out? It was - and still is, honestly - completely unthinkable that Extras like ourselves could do anything against *them*. But the two of you freed an entire party of adventurers from their influence!

DANIEL: Ah, about that.

CLARA: There was a gap in the audience.

DARIUS: What?

DANIEL: One of them turned away. And then another.

LOUISE: Only two drops in a vast ocean.

CLARA: True, but a keen eye only needs a moment of weakness.

DANIEL: And, to be fair, we had been watching for a long time.

DARIUS: Fair enough.

[A comfortable silence follows.]

CLARA: So, how is Barovia?

LOUISE, after a moment’s hesitation: Better. At KASIMIR’S insistance, PATRINA and STRAHD have been… talking.

DARIUS, aside: By which they mean sending each other death threats every other sentence of negotiations.

LOUISE, uncomfortable: Yes. But, technically, marginally better.

DARIUS: THE ABBOT has disappeared without explanation to anyone, but he left a note to be sent to ROSAI.

LOUISE: The souls of the dead are finally free.

DARIUS: Oh, and we may have taken up the fragments of vacant seat of THE POWERS THAT WERE.

CLARA and DANIEL: Huh.

LOUISE and DARIUS: Yeah.

[CLARA finishes their ice cream and gets to their feet, staring out at the empty seats with a hard look in their eyes.]

CLARA: What are you planning to do now?

LOUISE, hesitant: Well, it’s a complicated matter. To tell a story over and over again… that’s an act of love, isn’t it?

[DARIUS stands, too.]

DARIUS: But it’s also important to allow change. In stagnation lies death.

LOUISE: So, we’re going to let them tell their own stories, I think. We’ll just help them.

DANIEL: It’s a noble goal, to be sure. But you know what they say about the road to the Nine Hells.

DARIUS: That’s why we have you two. As the elder extras, I’m sure you’ll keep our heads on straight.

[CLARA peers down at DANIEL. The pair silently confer.]

CLARA: Sure.

DANIEL: Okay.

LOUISE: Great!

CLARA: For now, though, let’s just take a break. I’m *exhausted*.

DANIEL, nodding: Coming back from the obliteration of your soul is really tiring.

[Both DANIEL and CLARA flop down onto the stage and close their eyes. LOUISE shoots DARIUS a shrug and follows suit. DARIUS rolls their eyes but joins the others on the floor.]

[The lights come up. The show is over.]
