# Act 1, Scene 2: The Town of Barovia

LOUISE: Their first Tarokka card bade them to find a young heir, locked in the heart of their dead father's house. Uncertain as to whom this card could refer to, the party figured their more sure course of action would be to return to ISMARK and assist him. After all, he had claimed to be the burgomaster’s son and might have insight into the location of fellow heirs of Barovia’s minor nobility.

ISMARK’S dilemma was, as it turned out, a relatively simple one. His father had died and ISMARK wanted the local priest, a FATHER DONAVICH, to perform last rites so that his father’s spirit could rest. He only needed the party’s help in transporting the body.

SARALA offered to perform the ceremony herself, as she was ordained as a priest, which ISMARK gratefully accepted. Burying his father in the family plot was much easier, given the shorter distance and DONAVICH’S peculiarities of late.

With that sad task completed, ISMARK asked that the party stay the night and consider a further request of his. His sister IREENA was dead-set on opposing the reign of STRAHD, having gone so far as learning basic combat from one EZMERELDA D’AVENIR, a family friend. Despite his best efforts, ISMARK had been unable to talk her out of going so his only recourse was to ensure she had others with her. Their reaction to this was generally favourable since they were already seeking the destruction of the count.

In additional coincidences, ISMARK knew of two other noble families in Barovia. In the town of Vallaki, both the Vallakoviches (distant ancestors of the same royal line as the Zaroviches) and the Wachters (of unknown providence) had children: STELLA and VICTOR. In the morning, then, they would set out for Vallaki to see if either of these two were the person they sought.

With IREENA in tow, the party headed down the Old Svalich Road until they reached an old, abandoned windmill. Seeking a place to rest for an afternoon meal, MIRIK and ARHA went to ensure that the mill was indeed empty while SARALA examined the perimeter with IREENA. SARALA was immediately alarmed by the presence of several human teeth atop each of four standing stones, evidently the prelude to some manner of ritual. She and IREENA ran into Old Bonegrinder just in time to assist their friends in fending off the attacks of three very irate hags.

Though it was a close call, the adventurers were able to kill one of the hags, prompting the other two to flee. The breaking of their coven meant that they would be much more vulnerable and if leaving the mill was enough to preserve their lives, they were not so attached to the place as to stay.

After taking some time to dress their wounds and sample the local confectionaries (which they quickly regretted when MIRIK realized that they were made from human flesh), they set out again. ARHA had to scare off a small group of wolves that crossed their paths on the rest of the way to Vallaki but otherwise they were unbothered on their route.

An unmanned carriage in the road gave them momentary pause, as SARALA suggested they might take it and use it to expedite travel across the county but ARHA and MIRIK doubted that it wouldn’t be haunted or some form of mimic. Ultimately, they left it be, though SARALA insisted that if it was still there the next time they passed, they should take it.

Before long, they arrived in Vallaki, where it was obvious that preparations for a festival were underway. It was immediately obvious that despite the cheery atmosphere, the people had little enthusiasm toward the practice. ARHA spoke to a few of the townspeople in enough private to learn that both IZEK STRAZNI and LADY WACHTER had been stirring up revolutionary movements.

IZEK was unlikely to lead to anything useful to their quest but Wachterhaus was the potential home of the heir they sought. As such, they quickly decided to seek an audience with the lady of the house, trading on IREENA’S status as the daughter of Barovia’s burgomaster. News of his death had not left Barovia yet, allowing her the pretense of delivering the news and cultivating a relationship with the prospective new burgomaster of Vallaki, which would flatter WACHTER’S ego enough to guarantee that she would at least see them. MIRIK and SARALA, the more stealthy members of the group, could then break off and search the house for the trapped heir.

With the details of their plan arranged, the party headed north to Wachterhaus.

[DARIUS comes in from the stage, looking harried.]

DARIUS: They’ve spoken to BAGA YAGA *and* THE ABBOT. Only one agreed to help them with… whatever they’re doing, but if they keep this pace they’re going to ruin more continuity than we can fix.

LOUISE: Well, that move with DONAVICH was easy enough. I’m sure we can work around those two. BAGA YAGA, for example, we can move back to Berez.

DARIUS, sighing: I guess we’d better.

[LOUISE strides over to pat them on the shoulder.]

LOUISE: Buck up. I can help you move the chicken house thing. I know you hate those legs it has.

[DARIUS crosses their arms defensively but nods reluctantly, allowing LOUISE to pull them behind the curtain.]
