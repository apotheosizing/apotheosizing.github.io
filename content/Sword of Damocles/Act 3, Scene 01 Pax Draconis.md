# Act 3, Scene 1: Pax Draconis

[CLARA enters, rubbing at a thick layer of ghoulish makeup with a cloth. DANIEL follows, pulling off a tinfoil sabaton. Once both are divested of their costumes, they begin.]

DANIEL: Though now cracked by age and disuse, the imposing edifice of Argunvostholt was matched in Barovia only by the Abbey of Saint Markovia and Castle Ravenloft itself. 

The party approached with caution while ROSAI shared what information she had been able to glean from STRAHD’S writings on the fortress. ARGYNVOST was a silver dragon who had long ago taken a liking to the people of Barovia. His draconic nature was an open secret and he founded the Order of the Silver Dragon in an effort to protect the people of the land.

However, as the years wore on, ARGYNVOST grew weaker and the Order was increasingly run by his right hand man, a knight named EUGENIA HORNGAARD. Against STRAHD’S invading army the Order held out for a time but eventually it fell against a direct assault on the stronghold. Many knights were killed that night, including ARGYNVOST and EUGENIA.

The devastation of that final clash was writ across the stones of Argynvostholt, with the west wing of the manor shattered by a siege engine in days past.

As they crossed the threshold of the house, a shadow passed over them with a soft hiss. The party followed its path to the rear of the house by means of the remnants of the west wing. Despite their age, many of the fallen in the manor were not yet skeletonized, making it clear that something or someone was preserving what they could.

Facing toward the east, the back of the manor was occupied by a chapel. Three undead, wrapped in mist, knelt before the altar, praying. THADDEUS attempted to engage the revenants non-aggresively, hoping that the one who had bid them come was among them. The revenants did not respond in kind.

After a brief exchange of blows, THADDEUS reiterated the party’s good intentions and, very slowly, one of the revenants began to respond. THADDEUS concluded that this delay was likely caused by a foreign intelligence attempting to speak through them and he cast a spell to compress the time around them.

As the adventurers spoke with the revenant, it became clear that they were speaking with ARGYNVOST, or at least what remained of him. He explained that he could only exert a small amount of control over the revenants with great effort and otherwise they were animated only by their desire for revenge by a puppetmaster he could not identify.

Two of his knights had escaped this fate. With the last of his magical power, he had shielded EUGENIA and her beloved from the anger that had taken root in the rest of the Order. However, EUGENIA had slowly succumbed to hate nonetheless, leaving a single sound mind in the fortress.

ARGYNVOST asked the party to find a way to lay his knights to rest before growing silent, as the effort of keeping back the revenants taxed his old spirit further and further.

The party quickly moved upstairs and into the sights of several phantoms. Being spirits, ARGYNVOST could not assist them, but with the help of their allies they were able to banish the restless ghosts. As on the ground floor, almost every room had been looted and destroyed, but one remained in relative repair. It was here that the party chose to rest a while.

Not long after they had settled in, they found that someone was attempting to open the door. Clearly puzzled, the unknown person requested that whoever was inside vacate her room. The adventurers were suspicious at first but they were eventually convinced that she was the revenant who had spoken to them on the road. She introduced herself as SIR SIYANTSIVA and explained what she hoped they could do.

There was no means to dispel the magic that controlled the revenants but she had developed a theory. Long ago, there had been a beacon above Argynvostholt that had served as a great comfort and light to the Order. SIYANTSIVA supposed that a similar point for them to rally around might remind her kin of ARGYNVOST’S precepts and allow them to release their fury. She believed that the skull of the great dragon, which lay now within Castle Ravenloft, would be suitable.

CLARA, dramatically and then bored: Increasingly, all roads lead to Ravenloft... not very subtle, are they?

DANIEL, surpressing a grin: With little else to be found in Argynvostholt, the adventurers made to depart. Just as KAI touched the doorframe, they heard a voice. EUGENIA stood atop the balustrade, sword in hand, and she proclaimed she would not allow them to kill STRAHD. This stance seemed bizarre, until it became clear that from her warped perspective his death offered him nothing but respite from the torment of this land. She was willing to make all others suffer so long as he did too.

Before she could make to strike them down, the doors were forced open by a blast of wind and ARGYNVOST bade them to flee. Without a moment of hesitation, the group did so, disappearing into the dark.
