# Act 1, Scene 8: Something Borrowed

CLARA: The adventurers were welcomed with open arms by THE ABBOT. They explained what had transpired with IREENA and he quickly moved TATYANA to the abbey's infirmary to examine her. Anxious to hear of her condition, the party milled around the battlements until THE ABBOT informed them that TATYANA would benefit from at least a night's rest.

[DANIEL coughs loudly and fakely to draw attention to themself.]

DANIEL: During this time, incidentally, BARNABUS bullied a poor, working-class actor. How dastardly!

CLARA: Over a simple dinner, THE ABBOT told the group that he was not able to make heads or tails of TATYANA's sudden existence. Reincarnation was common in Barovia, as the MISTS OF RAVENLOFT interfered in the passage of the soul to the afterlife, but such a complete overwrite of an established personality so late in life was something he had never seen before.

The evening was uneventful, aside from WREN biting BARNABUS. [ASIDE: You didn't hear it from me, but he deserved it after that bit with the scarecrows.] By morning, TATYANA had recovered enough to join the adventurers at breakfast. However, THE ABBOT recommended that she stay in his care rather than accompany the party to their next destination.

They agreed, deciding that it was probably wise to leave her in Krezk while she was still adjusting to the future she had found herself in. The adventurers departed for the Wizard of Wines a few hours later, as it was on the way to Yester Hill.

As they traveled, the party was stalked by needle blights. They were able to fight off several of the creatures until a veritable tide stepped out of the woods, surging toward the Martikov house. The party kept just ahead of the needle blights and barricaded themselves inside the winery to take a moment to collect themselves.

As they soon discovered, they were not alone. A druid named Barta demanded to know what they were doing in the winery. The party flipped the question around on her and she grudgingly explained that she was searching for three magical gems - the Seeds of Arietis, to the canny audience member. She claimed that they had been taken from their rightful owners to be used for the winery. The adventurers were able to avoid a fight by agreeing to look for them as well.

Other druids within the winery reacted in various ways to the party, from fighting them to fleeing. The winery itself seemed to hold no notable secrets, though the bedrooms above the production area did hold all the usual signs of being lived in. Even the study only held shipping manifests and a few trinkets to which the adventurers helped themselves. If they wanted to find the gems, perhaps they would have to search farther afield?
