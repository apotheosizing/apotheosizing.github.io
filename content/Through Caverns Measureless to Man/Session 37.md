# Session 37

An hour before sunrise, Flora stole out of the tent Oadicius had fabricated for the night. Using a new magical secret she had gleaned, she intended to create a homunculus from the disparate pieces of Korth she had taken from across the Dark Seas. She explained her plan to Aiyah, whom she would be using to draw the blood required for the ritual - her theory was that incorporating another intelligence into the vessel might support Korth's shattered mind.

The rest of the party - and a majority of the residents of the town - were awoken by a piercing shriek. Flora had succeeded in creating a homunculus but it was in such agony that it could do nothing but scream. Fortunately, Flora was able to cast a mind blank on the homunculus, knocking it out. When she communicated with Aiyah, she told Flora that it was primarily Korth that was in pain.

Flora concluded that the best course of action was to remove as much of Korth as possible from the homunculus with her next casting of the spell, replacing the missing parts with other magic items she had collected over her travels. It proved successful, as when Aiyah awoke the pain had dulled to a background ache. The other three members of the party were varyingly disapproving of Flora - Oadicius in particular thinking that it should be destroyed. However, she was undeterred and felt confident that one more casting of the spell the next day would allow her to correct the problem.

Using the orb of Uria, Oadicius asked what the goddess' thoughts on incarnating Korth were. She told him that it was foolish to even attempt such a thing, as it was Korth's mind, not its body, that needed to be restored. When Oadicius inquired further, Uria suggested that finding Korth's body would assist in repairing the damage done to its mind, though regardless, any healing process would take time.

Once they had recovered enough to do so, the party returned to the material plane to ensure that Bethany had arrived safely. Eris' stewardess greeted them at the door and informed them that Bethany remained under the effects of the spell of imprisonment. Only a dispelling of equal measure could break magic of that magnitude, meaning that she would have to remain in slumber until the party were capable of such a thing.

The matter of the last boneclaw remained and, short of Eaton himself, it was the only certain objective the party had for the time being. Flora's crystal ball revealed that it was no longer on the Shadowfel, but it had returned to the temple of Korth where Victor, Flora, and Yulicese had first learned of Eaton's fate.

Oadicius took the opportunity to inform the party of what Uria had said. Victor, now in the final stages of preparing his flesh golem, was interested in pursuing the recovery of Korth's mind, particularly in light of seeing what had happened to Flora's homunculus. Oadicius agreed to assist in the matter, as he had an unspoken investment in its success. Via sending, Victor contacted Yldor with the basic outline of the information they had been given and asked if he and his sister would like to accompany the party to the north where Korth was rumoured to have fallen. They were both more than willing.

Before departing for the temple to Korth, the party did some shopping. Oadicius was able to purchase the remaining components for his adamantine plate and Flora stocked up on healing potions. The four decided it would be best to wait until the following day to teleport away, to ensure they were refreshed for the battle ahead.

It was strangely nostalgic to return to the Lifeless Archipelago, so changed. Like the party themselves, it had not been stagnant - the shattered statues and destroyed walls of the temple had been reconstructed by some unknown individual. The party wondered what purpose had driven those efforts but they could draw no conclusions given the length of time that had passed since they had last visited the island. In the chapel, the boneclaw awaited them, unaccompanied by any other undead creature. With the renewed power of Torkan's Justice, Moreen once again recited the words of her oath and destroyed it once and for all.

Having secured the temple, Victor cast a spell to learn more of Korth's fate. The legends told of Korth's battle with Tikora, to the north of its patron city. When it was slain, its body plunged into the northern sea, never to be recovered. As they intended to travel beyond the Stalamite Mountain Chain, they contacted Yldor and Yrssah once again. They arrived shortly after and discussed the current knowledge of their destination.

Limited as it was, Yrssah suggested that they scry on Korth. Using the crystal ball, Flora saw a massive creature of black feathers and tar, surrounded by snow-capped mountains. Time had weathered it heavily, though it remained untouched by the elements. She had no opportunity to observe more closely, as the mind reading properties of the scrying focus took prominence.

It was an all-encompassing scream, one of which the homunculus' cries were merely an echo. Flora was shielded from the brunt of its force by her mind blank but it was still overpowering. She released concentration on the spell soon after and shared her findings with the party. It was clear that it lay beyond the known expanse of the mountains but they could learn no more until they reached those unmapped reaches. Thus, the six seekers of Korth embarked in the folding boat, sailing to the north shore to begin their expedition.
