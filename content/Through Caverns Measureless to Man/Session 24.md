# Session 24

The wraith commanders conjured the ghosts of the soldiers who had been under their command in life to fend of the party’s incursion into the temple. Between the party and the wraiths, the room where the battle had begun was crowded, making it difficult to manoeuvre through the enemies to any particular quarry. With a quick illusion, Flora was able to put the wraiths into a stupor that left them sitting ducks for the party to pick off. Careful to avoid waking up more than a few at a time, the four were able to take out all of the wraiths without expending much more of their flagging resources.

Once the room was secured, the party decided to take an hour to recover from their battles, knowing that they would need to encounter the vessel of Korth in order to reach the staircase to the sixth floor of the temple. It was not a prospect that the party exulted in. Having steeled themselves for the difficult struggle to come, they returned to the western part of the floor. At their approach, the horrid simulacrum of the Drowned Crow dragged itself up, revealing that this attempt at embodying Korth had been given a multitude of eyes along its body, each of which fixed its attention on Victor.

Its fixation on the wizard was something of a boon, as it meant that the rest of the party was in less immediate danger and the majority of Flora and Oadicius’ restorative magic could be focused on one target. However, this advantage only served to level the battlefield. Due to its ability to see any angle of attack against it, the vessel was able to avoid all but a few of the most well-targeted strikes, even managing to shrug off Victor’s attempt to disintegrate it from outside its gaze. The battle became a war of attrition in which the party needed to destroy the golem before it completely exhausted them. In the end, Moreen was able to imbue her blade with Torkan’s light and land the final blow just in the nick of time.

The unspoken concern that one of the failed vessels had been so formidable a foe was palpable as the party retraced their steps to the mouth of the temple, intending to return to Yldor’s tower for the night. When the party arrived Yldor was embroiled in some experiment, indicated by a hastily scrawled notice not to disturb him attached to the door of his study. Flora, of course, ignored this to deliver an eye she had carved out of the vessel, an intrusion that he did not entirely mind. Victor communicated via sending with Eris, informing her of all that had occurred since they left Ludenwick. She mentioned that she would soon be occupied for at least the next two weeks with unspecified business but that Rachel would be at their disposal once they had slain the boneclaw that lurked in the depths of Bonehaven.

Returning to the temple to explore the newly opened sixth floor, the party were greeted for once without hostilities. A group of duergar stood expectantly at the foot of the stairway, eager to welcome them to the Silk Market. As first-time visitors, there were a variety of forms that they would be required to fill out depending on their intended capacity in the market. Although they considered simply passing through the market to reach the floor below, the possibility that they might be able to find powerful new artifacts or other useful goods in the market on which to spend the mountain of platinum they had taken from the first floor was a lure enough for all four of the adventurers.

Once the requisite paperwork was complete, the party went their separate ways to make their purchases. Flora forewent the winding halls of sundry stalls to visit SILK: The Restaurant and make reservations for the four of them once their shopping was finished at the rather steep prix fixe. Oadicius sought out an engineer who was able to provide him with schematics for a variety of humanoid and non-humanoid constructs, as well as recommend a seller in the trade goods area who could provide sufficiently durable metal for Oadicius’ needs.

As he made his way back to the trade room, Victor slipped away to the casino to make arrangements for the acquisition of the vital organs outlined in his hard-won manual of golem creation from a trio of black market dealers. He was hindered only slightly by the workings of a disguised Flora who seemed set on making his plans for constructing a new vessel where he had failed before arduous, if not impossible to carry out. Meanwhile, Moreen sold several of her extraneous enchanted items to cushion the purchases of new equipment that would afford her a greater edge in combat.

After an hour or so of wandering the market separately, the party converged near the magic item stalls to consult on any additional needs or wants, keen to take advantage of the many rare offerings the market held.
