# Session 27

The battle with Gadreel was brief but not without its difficulties. Moreen absorbed much of the brunt of his attacks, allowing the rest of the party to whittle down his defenses until he was satisfied by their prowess. With a wave of his hand, the altar to Uria transformed into a set of stairs that would lead them down deeper into the temple. Before the party descended, Gadreel offered them healing, restoring the damage he had done during their combat.

The staircase led to a door that turned out to be the back side of a bookshelf. The four emerged in a room lined with such shelves. A cursory glance revealed that this collection dealt primarily with the creation and maintenance of undead creatures. Moreen and Victor took advantage of the lack of hostile presences on this level to do some research into the nature of their enemy. Flora, not having enough familiarity with research outside of the focused work she’d done with Esker to offer much assistance, headed off to other areas of the library. Oadicius opted to work on his designs for the construct he had purchased at Silk’s market.

In her wanderings, Flora eventually came across a table atop which a simple box sat. It appeared to be hewn of ivory, with an inscription written along its edge. Flora, intrigued by the oddity of the box, lifted its lid. At once, a sharp pain settled in the back of her head. As the pounding worsened, she sent one of the creatures from her bag of tricks, a dog, to find the party.

In the meantime, Victor and Moreen had discovered texts that discussed the existence of “greater liches”, liches who had spent eons on the earth and as consequence could draw from a much deeper well of magic than the typical lich. Operating under the assumption that it was wise to prepare for the worst and act as though Eaton had reached these heights, they gathered several books that might offer them insight into strategies to combat a greater lich.

As they did so, Moreen broached the subject of Victor’s brother. Flora had mentioned him during Gadreel’s trials but did not provide many details, leaving Moreen curious as to the circumstances of Victor’s involvement. Victor said shortly that he had made a mistake and made it clear he didn’t want to discuss it further.

At this point, the dog arrived. It carried a note from Flora that asked for help, alarming the rest of the party. When she didn’t respond to magical communication, the party followed the dog back to where she had opened the box. Flora had fallen unconscious, the box having tumbled out of her hands when she crumpled to the floor. Using the spell he had recently acquired, Victor was able to lift the curse on Flora, restoring her to consciousness. She had the vague impression that she had been talking to someone, though she couldn’t remember who or what they had spoken about.

Identifying the properties of the box (through Paracelsus, to prevent anyone else from falling prey to its effects) uncovered the fact that its creator was made aware when someone was brought to unconsciousness by contact with the box, but shed no light on its purpose. There was some debate as to whether or not the party should risk bringing the box with them, ending with them placing it in a bag of holding for safekeeping.

Moreen and Victor had barely made a dent in the potential research material on greater liches but Flora’s encounter with the box made it clear that they may be no safer in the library than on any other floor of the temple. They decided to take the books with them on their return journey to read in the security of Ydlor’s tower and instead continue to the next level. The moment that the word “exit” was spoken, the way forward appeared in a nearby bookcase.

Unlike the relative comfort of the library, the subsequent floor resembled the cavern in which they had met Gadreel. At its centre stood a well. Bobbing on the surface of the water was the head of another crow. All of the failed vessels had been horrid monstrosities but this placid creature was perhaps the most grotesque of them all. Its neck twisted unnaturally from its body in a way that suggested it was broken and its eyes looked unfocusedly at the haphazard brickwork of the well. A boneclaw waited nearby, lunging toward the party at their approach.

Strange as the presence of the well was, the water it contained conducted lightning well, bypassing the vessel’s many resistances. Against the wielder of Torkan’s Justice, the boneclaw was taken out of commission relatively quickly, unable to withstand Moreen’s onslaught for long. The vessel, with the singleminded focus of its kin, tried to ensorcel Victor. When it became clear that the enchantment would not hold, it shifted onto its feet with a horrible crunch of its broken bones and begun to fight in earnest. Although it was not nimble, the strikes it did land hit with considerable force. Nonetheless, with Oadicius and Flora keeping the party in fighting shape, Moreen was able to decapitate the vessel, rendering it inert.

At the end of the cavern, a false wall gave way to a small study. On the ground lay the corpse of a drow whom the party identified as Yldor’s sister by the name written in her spellbook – Yrssah – and the ring on her finger that Yldor had asked them to retrieve. On her desk sat several volumes of collated research, chronicling the creation of the various failures the party had fought throughout the temple. Alongside these works were reference books that detailed information on Korth, Sydra, Torkan, and Uria.

As the body was intact, if desiccated by the decades it had lain in the temple, the party brought the corpse back to Yldor’s tower. As Yldor spoke of his plans for the burial, it became clear to the party that Oadicius would be able to restore her to life, though it would require all of his magical reserves and necessitate a day of recovery before returning to the Temple of Uria. Yldor had diamonds enough to facilitate the ritual and agreed to payment for Oadicius’ services.

Once the ritual was complete, Yldor and Yrssah retreated to Yldor’s study to discuss what had happened in the last years since her disappearance. Having an entire day to themselves, the party worked on their own personal projects in isolation. Moreen, interested in the book Yrssah had obtained about Torkan, spent some time reading about the god in whose service she had unexpectedly found herself. As she did so, her blade glowed with white light. When she unsheathed the sword, the light shifted into a small sphere that addressed her in an unfamiliar voice. It said cryptically that it was pleased with her actions so far before disappearing. In its wake, an additional inscription had been etched into the blade, revealing a new magical ability to Moreen.
