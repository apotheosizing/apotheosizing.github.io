# Session 3

The following day, Eris did indeed have a further request for the two adventurers, stemming again from the matter of her uncle’s transformation into a lich. In order to better respond to the possibility that she may need to confront Eaton, she had hoped to get her hands on ancient texts with information about liches - both how to become one and how to kill one. On the island of Kalepick Keep, to the east of Ludenwick, lay the family tomb of the Foebreakers beneath which lay a library where these books could be found. Accepting her request, Flora and Victor set off once again on the Errant Seeker. Their journey to the island was fairly smooth, barring an attack from a group of sahaguin and a flock of bloodhawks. Once ashore, the two decided to forego adding any members of the crew of the Seeker to their party as they travelled from the town of Kalepick to the tomb several miles away and begun to explore the crypt itself.

Greeted by statues representing the past deeds of ancestors long buried, they proceeded into the adjacent room and were quickly attacked by skeletons. Fending them off, they continued to move through the catacombs, encountering several more clusters of skeletons and riddle-locked doors sealing the way forward along the way. They appeared to reach a dead end upon reaching the end of the main burial chamber but the pair were able to move to the subterranean level below through a hidden door they discovered after some investigation.

Immediately, the two were attacked by a pair of duregar, confronted with a couple more riddles, and finally came across a maze. Several dead ends later, they reached the centre of the maze, where a duregar and its guard drake protected a treasure. The maze’s other exit led to a large library containing books on various subjects, including the books the party had been asked to retrieve. Having cleared out the tomb of hostile creatures, Flora and Victor were able to bring the books back to the surface without further incident. On the return journey, Victor perused the books and learned about the lich’s weakness in the form of their phylactery. With several lengthy and contradictory books on her plate, Eris told the two that she would likely be occupied for some time, but gave them permission to use the Errant Seeker to pursue their own goals in the meantime.
