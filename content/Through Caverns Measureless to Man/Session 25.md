# Session 25

The party whiled away the hours until the reservation Flora had secured for them perusing the various stalls of the market, making small purchases along the way. In particular, Oadicius made arrangements with the recommended seller of building materials for a third of the metal he estimated would we required for the construct to be delivered to the Black Waltz via teleportation circle.

As noon approached, the four headed toward SILK: The Restaurant. Even at this hour, the restaurant was moderately busy, a sign of its reputation. The meal was a several course affair, with each dish being more elaborate than the last. Once the party had finished their desserts, they felt as though they had been imbued with a supernatural fortitude. As they paid their bills, however, their waiter informed them apologetically that the market was currently being evacuated.

In the last several minutes a strange construct had appeared amongst the stalls and begun causing havoc. Intrigued, the party headed back into the market proper to see what they could do. The construct was a strange sight – a single eye stared unblinking from where a head would ordinarily sit and a spinning golden disk was affixed to its chest. Rather than rampaging violently through the market, it was methodically searching each stall.

As it was non-violent, the party attempted to speak with it and discover what it was searching for. The construct informed them in a tinny voice that its target was named Mirabar and that they were wanted in Mechanus for grievous breach of contract. Flora and Moreen recalled that one of the duergar who had greeted them had been named Mira.

The construct had no interest in the party, allowing them to leave without comment when they decided to go speak with Mira. The party encountered her in the hallway, dressed in full armour and heading toward the market. When they described the construct to her, she blanched, telling them that fighting it would be the height of foolishness and asking them to instead go to her office and use her sending stone to call someone to assist.

From the summons of the sending stone, a tiefling teleported into the office. She introduced herself as Silk and listened to the party recount what had happened. The construct was called a marut and had likely left with Mira by the time she’d arrived. The contract in question had indeed been breached, though only because its recent revision had not been properly filed with the proper authorities. She would go to Mechanus to deal with the matter personally but she had been banned from the plane long ago.

Nonetheless, not all was lost. Silk had hidden a copy of the revised contract in the sarcophagus of a mummy lord on the level beneath the market. If the party could retrieve the document, she could send it to Mechanus and appeal for Mira’s release. With the promise of a reward for their co-operation, the party had no objections.

The seventh floor of the temple was guarded by a boneclaw who patrolled between the sarcophagi. The party, surprised by the sight of a boneclaw so far from the depths of the temple where Eaton had set his to guard the portal, attacked. Having defeated a number of the undead creatures, the boneclaw itself did not put up much resistance. It was the mummy lord, who joined the battle shortly after it began, who posed a threat to the party. He wielded not only divine magic that marked him as another of Uria’s priests but the formidable curse of mummification.

His mere touch was enough to infect all of the party other than Moreen with a slow-acting rot that would eventually reduce them to dust if left untreated. The mummy lord was able to knock Victor unconscious but the party still had the advantage in numbers and was able to defeat him before he could do any dire harm to anyone else.

Within his gilded sarcophagus lay the copy of the contract they had been sent to retrieve, as well as the canopic jar that held the priest’s heart. The party destroyed it to prevent the mummy lord from reconstituting and returned to the market visibly worse for wear. Silk, who had been working to calm her employees and patrons in the wake of the marut’s appearance, was grateful for their assistance and cured those afflicted of the curse the mummy had laid on them. Furthermore, she offered them a night of rest at the market and a complimentary breakfast from SILK: The Restaurant.

The party spent the remainder of the day on the sixth level. Victor spent a number of hours searching for and copying the specifications for new spells and Moreen sent a courier to her fiancée in Phentrim. After a good night’s rest and a hearty breakfast, the party returned to the seventh floor.

They battled through a room of lesser mummies to proceed further into the space. Without a lord to command them, the mummies were little obstacle to the refreshed adventurers and they fell one by one against the party’s onslaught.

Much like they had adorned the walls of Cyrise’s tomb, murals on the winding halls of the burial chambers depicted the life of the priest who had been laid to rest here. They continued all the way down to the stairwell, which would lead them down to the eighth floor of the temple, where unknown threats lay in wait.
