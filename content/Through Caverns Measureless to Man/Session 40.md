# Session 40

Upon their arrival at Bonavida, the party encountered a familiar face - Sarai, the wife of the interred Saint Cyrise. The party was initially keen to trade upon their prior friendly interaction but Flora and Victor's old theft from the druids soured things considerably.

Flora explained that they required larkspur in order to defeat Eaton but Sarai was not interested in aiding them. Larkspur was a sacred plant to the druid circle and she would not allow them to remove it from the island. As Eaton had been successfully repelled from its shores, she did not feel the same urgency as the residents of Ludenwick on the matter of his destruction.

Negotiations soon broke down and combat ensued. Five archdruids were a significant threat, given their ability to take on other forms to protect themselves from harm - one made more so by the retributive removal of Victor from the battle after he killed one of the druids. However, between Flora's polymorphed draconic strength and Oadicius and Moreen's efforts, they were able to force the druids to retreat.

After some healing, the party searched the greenhouse for larkspur to no avail. Instead, they followed the druids into the network of tunnels below the nearby shed and pressed their advantage. One of the archdruids relented and fetched them the requisite quantity of larkspur.

They were willing to hand it over under two conditions: the first being that they paid for it and the second that they never return to Bonavida again. The party agreed and teleported back to Eris' manor mere moments after they had the herb in hand.

The only remaining ritual material was a piece of the lich. Having a day to prepare, the party split up to take care of their own projects and shopping, as was customary. Flora borrowed some fancy jewelry from Eris, most notably an old family engagement ring, Oadicius worked on his mechanical construct, and Moreen procured a potion or two.

As soon as they awoke, the party plane shifted to the Shadowfell. They were not privy to the exact details of when Eaton might arrive so the simplest thing to do was to be there well in advance. After four hours of waiting, their patience was rewarded with the appearance of Eaton.

He was more than willing to fight them, though their strange fixation on removing one of his fingers was inexplicable. In combination with Flora's implication that the ring she wore had been given to her by both Bethany and Eris, he was so bewildered that the party was able to take one of his fingers and retreat back to the material plane without sustaining any major injuries.

Eris had prepared all other elements of the ritual for their return, allowing them to begin their work shortly after the party arrived. With all of the party lending their efforts to the ritual, it proved successful. Eaton's phylactery was now nothing more valuable than a simple trinket. However, the matter of divining the means to destroy it remained.
