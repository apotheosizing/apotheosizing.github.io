# Halloween Special

Outside the confines of normal spacetime, our five adventurers received a missive from Kada, the psychic Flora and Victor consulted during their attempt to exorcise the haunted doll many months ago, requesting their protection on a job she had taken on. Those wealthy enough to settle on the isle of Sunlight Springs had originally considered the shipwrecked vessel on their shores to be an interested conversation starter at their many lavish parties but the allure soon faded as the wails of the damned kept them up well into the night. Kada had been contracted to exorcise these spirits but, as mostly a non-combatant, she would require some backup.

The crew of the Errant Seeker set off after the party exchanged pleasantries with Kada, and the ship was favoured with calm waters and a lack of hostile encounters on their voyage to the isle. Moored on the coast of the sunny shores, the party - with the additions of Kada and Ulric - made their way to the wreck in a dinghy over the course of a half hour.

As they approached the wreck, the extent of the damage done to it became clear. The upper deck was almost entirely rotted away and holes in the hull of the ship told of the totality of its defeat at the hands of the drow whoâ€™d sunk it. Heading into the remains of the body of the ship, the party found that its geometry was utterly distorted, with walls intersecting at impossible angles and what should have been the inverted bell of the hull was stretched into a mess of shapes. Victor deduced that it was likely the result of extremely excessive use of extraplanar gates in the area but the party could not imagine why such magic would be cast.

When they ventured deeper into the mangled depths of the ship, they were beset by sword wraiths, spectres, and poltergeists - all of which were to be expected on a haunted shipwreck. Among the many ghosts was one that Flora recognized as the being that had once possessed the haunted doll, returned from the realm they had banished it to. In the course of the battle, Kada was able to banish it to the Shadowfel, this time hopefully for good.

The battle, though long, posed little danger to a seasoned group of adventurers and they encroached further into the dark of the hull, reaching a large pit over which a clump of colliding walls were suspended, seemingly by nothing, and were attacked by more spectres and wraiths that they soon dispatched. The final blow was a decisive kick by Moreen of a wraith into the gaping pit that led beneath.

It was below deck that things become stranger. Rather than ghouls and poltergeists alone, the party encountered a horde of shadow demons and hellhounds. The sheer numbers made it a battle of endurance, one that became all the more perilous when a draegloth lumbered out of the shadows midway through the fight. Despite exhausting nearly all of their resources in the process, the adventurers emerged victorious. At the end of a staircase leading nowhere, a portal that must have allowed the fiends entrance to this plane stood open.

As Kada begun the ritual to close the passage, the party explored the now empty ship in search of anything notable. Hoards of jewels and caches of items of impossible magical power could be found in every nook and cranny of the hold but, before the party could partake of any of it, Fate Themself unwound all that had occurred and restored the five to their rightful place in the timeline.
