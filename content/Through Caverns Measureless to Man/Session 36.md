# Session 36

Solemnly, the party retreated to the locked room where Bethany had been held prisoner. Oadicius would need time to prepare to transport them across the planes and the battered survivors of the encounter with Eaton required rest. They spoke little, concentrating on the tasks ahead.

In the morning, Oadicius communed with Morin to seek a boon. He asked his god if he would make Flora's body once more a proper vessel for her soul. Morin agreed, so long as the party destroyed the amulet Eaton wore. It contained Torkan's divine power and Morin wanted it destroyed. Oadicius agreed and Morin told him that Eaton could be found east, to the horizon.

The mote of fire that had accompanied Oadicius since the party's emergence from Bonehaven consumed itself and Flora's body in a holy blaze that restored it to perfect condition. Oadicius was then able to revive Flora.

With her soul restored, Flora used the scrying mirror to see where Eris' body had been taken. She was being kept in an unfamiliar place, guarded by a wraith under Eaton's control who was preparing her for a ritual. There was little time to lose and so the party began their travel east. The valley surrounding the mountain which had previously been filled with undead was empty, allowing the party to travel at speed.

After several days of travel, the party realized that the horizon was visibly closer. Unlike the material plane, the Shadowfel had an end where it melded with the plane of Negative Energy. At the end of the horizon, the ubiquitous mist intensified, obscuring the dark figures that moved behind the seam between the two planes. As Morin had told them, Eaton stood at the edge of the world, awaiting them.

A nightwalker stepped over the planar border to join him, recreating their last encounter almost perfectly. Given how poorly that battle had gone, the party focused on shattering the amulet. Though Oadicius was able to banish the nightwalker, the party was barely keeping themselves on their feet against the powerful magic Eaton wielded.

As the party's strength flagged, Oadicius sent a bolt of light streaking toward Eaton. Guided by the hand of Morin, it struck true, shattering the amulet. Blinding light erupted from the broken amulet, providing cover for the party to make their escape. They gathered around Victor, who teleported them back to the town they had stayed in at the beginning of their time in the Shadowfel with the sound of Eaton's screams ringing in their ears.

Once they had regained their sight, Moreen noticed a glow from her bag. Torkan's Justice once again gleamed with light, though it was not as bright as it had been when Moreen had first taken it up at the temple to the god of the sun. Even so, the party had regained a powerful weapon and would be able to destroy Eaton's final boneclaw when they next encountered it.
