# Session 33

Without a means to send a message ahead of their arrival, the party teleported to Saut that afternoon. They arrived on-target, at the gates of the crystalline palace of Saut. A guard approached the party, requesting that they announce themselves. Moreen explained that she sought a meeting with Princess Genevieve and that the rest of the party were accompanying her. The guard allowed them through the gates and sent a more junior member of the guard to fetch the princess.

Genevieve was delighted to see her beloved again after so long apart. She arranged for an impromptu teatime for herself and the party so that she could catch up with Moreen in the gardens. She endured Flora's disruptions long enough to extend an invitation to the party to stay in the palace for the night and suggest that Moreen at least stay for the tournament tomorrow. The prize for the champion was not only a hefty purse of platinum but a dance with the princess.

Despite the uncertainty of Eaton's plans now that they had foiled the theft of the treasury of Ludenwick, there was little they could do other than confront Eaton directly. They had no inkling yet of his whereabouts so the party concluded that there would be little harm in staying for the tournament. Once the matter was decided, Genevieve and Moreen retired to Genevieve's quarters for a less chaotic discussion while the rest of the party went into the city.

Flora and three goats she had summoned out of her bag of tricks made some money entertaining the people with many a physically impossible trick, something that Victor in particular tried not to think about as he visited Saut's magic shops. Meanwhile, Oadicius found an artificer trade school with a shop-front where he could purchase schematics. He spoke with a dwarf named Moira Brighthelm and discussed his designs with her for a few hours. At the end of their conversation, Moira gave him a modified sending stone so that they could keep in touch.

Dinner that evening offered a chance for Moreen to assess her competition for the next day's tournament. Most of those who had signed up were regular competitors whom Moreen recognized from previous tournaments, including her old rival Lady Blackwell, but several rumours suggested other possible obstacles. A number of warriors from Aloria were in the running to sweep the axe-throw and a mysterious up-and-comer from a minor noble house had been a rising star in the preliminary jousting events.

Bright and early, the party headed down to the castle grounds with the rest of the participants so that Moreen could sign-up for the events of her choice. Even at such an early hour, market stands laden with food, crafts, and other wares had been erected for the crowd that was trickling in. To be named the champion, one would have to emerge victorious in three events so Moreen chose the axe-throw, jousting, and sword duels.

In the joust, Moreen arrived at the final match to find herself up against Marshal, the newcomer she had heard about the night before. Despite his youth, he was a formidable opponent. Her victory against him was narrow at 3 - 2. He was a good sportsman even in the face of his loss and looked forward to facing her again later in the duels.

One who was not so gracious was Blackwell, who approached Moreen before the axe-throw they would both be participating in to sneer at her. Though the axe was not Moreen's weapon of choice, she put what she had learned in the last five months of adventuring to use in order to beat Blackwell in the final round by two points.

With two victories under her belt, only the duel stood in the way of Moreen being crowned champion. Her semi-final match was set to be against Blackwell, as she had lost to Marshal. Thanks to her cool head and keenness with a blade, Moreen defeated Blackwell without breaking a sweat, infuriating her opponent. All that remained was her duel with Marshal. Having just prior faced Blackwell, Moreen had some difficulty dodging Marshal's attacks. Eventually, she was defeated, leaving both her and Marshal with two events in which they were victorious.

In order to break the tie, the two faced each other in battle with the spear. Though Marshal was an accomplished jouster, his strength was no match for Moreen's. She emerged victorious and claimed the championship title. Once the main event was over, the party enjoyed the festival games until the time came for the feast.

Even among those who had lost the tournament, there was an air of good spirits about the celebration, with the exception of a brooding Blackwell. After an hour of feasting, the orchestra struck the chords of the first dance. Moreen and Genevieve took the floor, followed by a number of other pairs including Flora and a protesting Victor as well as Oadicius and the runner-up Marshal. At the conclusion of the first dance, Moreen took a knee before Genevieve and made her proposal of marriage. Genevieve accepted immediately and the onlookers gave their approval of the happy couple.

The beautiful moment would not last long, however, as an unnatural blanket of pitch black covered the skies. It was deeper than night and it became clear that the sun, which had hung low in the sky, no longer shone over the land. Panic spread through the assembled guests and the party came together to discuss what they should do. Flora received a message from Eris who told her that her uncle had contacted her and suggested they return to Ludenwick as soon as possible. The mote of flame that Oadicius had been given by Morin spoke up, telling him that the sun god had been slain.

The god's words were confirmed by the dullness of the normally glorious Torkan's Justice, which had lost much of its power. Though she was loathe to leave her fianc√©e mere moment after their engagement, Genevieve bid Moreen to go, so long as she returned safely to Saut.

The party teleported back to the Silent Palace, where Eris awaited them. She explained that Eaton had contacted her for a "family reunion" in the Shadowfel. The suggestion was nefarious enough but Eris knew that the Shadowfel existed near the planar border of the Negative Energy Plane, home of the nightwalkers. Given Eaton's intentions to command the nightwalkers, it was obvious that he intended to summon them forth in the Shadowfel.

Despite not having a tuning fork for the realm, Eris was able to move them across the planar barrier without the necessary component. The party arrived in a lifeless swamp filled with gnarled, cracked trees. An ambient dismal feeling oppressed the party, making it clear that the change of plane was more than just a change of scenery. Now that they were on the same plane, Flora used her crystal ball to scry on Bethany. She was unconscious, floating above a stone slab. Nearby, Eaton was working at a desk. Though he appeared to be engrossed in his work, he took notice of the scrying sensor immediately. Amused by the party's persistence, he told them that he could be found at the temple to Uria atop the Shatterstone mountains before snuffing out the sensor.

Maps of the Shadowfel had never been made by denizens of the material plane, but Oadicius would be able to prepare a spell to act as a wayfinder in the morning. To allow them to rest comfortably in the swamp, Eris constructed a small tower and set about warding it from intruders. During the process, Oadicius questioned her about how she had been able to planeshift so easily. Eris was clearly reluctant to answer but she divulged that her powers as a sorcerer originated from the Shadowfel, allowing her to use her own power as an anchor to the plane. Oadicius did not press her further, for which she was grateful. Once the tower was ready, the party begun their preparations, both mental and physical, for what they would face in the plane of shadows.
