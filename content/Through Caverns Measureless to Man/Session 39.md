# Session 39

At length, the party debated various options for containing Korth's wayward soul, eventually settling upon the use of the candle Victor had found in the ruins of Eaton's first hideout so many months hence. The remaining obstacle was locating the soul in the vast expanse of the Shadowfell. Using her ever-faithful crystal ball Flora was able to scry upon the soul, though initially she could not see it due to its ethereal nature. The application of a spell of truesight remedied this and Flora was able to spot the form of a crow on the horizon.

She described the surroundings to Victor who then attempted to teleport the party to the location. A series of mishaps ensued during which both he and Eris tried multiple times to successfully teleport to the soul, only ending when Flora invoked the mighty power of wish to bypass the inaccuracies of the teleportation spells available to the party. They arrived above a deep gorge carved into the weathered landscape and immediately began plummeting through the air. To make matters worse, proximity to the soul caused all of the party except Flora and Oadicius to be overcome with sorrow, making them unable to speak - or, more importantly, cast spells.

However, between the party's various flying broomsticks, they were able to avert the crisis and enact their plan. Using yet another wish, Victor was able to siphon the soul into the candle. With their goal accomplished, Oadicius returned the party to the mountainous resting place of Korth's body. Yldor and Yrsa were awaiting their return, having formulated in the party's absence a ritual to restore the soul to the body. The group retired to bed for the evening to ensure they were well-rested for their participation in the casting the following day.

Yldor led the ritual, drawing upon the assistance of all those in the party who were able to lend their magical talents to the effort. However, no visible change in the god came of it. Oadicius consulted Uria on the matter, learning that the burning of the candle to release the soul would require several days.

They didn't have the luxury of days worth of time but Yrsa bypassed the need to wait by casting a wish of her own. Over the course of the next few minutes, the wax dribbled down into a stub and Korth's dull and lifeless eyes began to glow. A cold light, brighter than any mortal could bear, swept over the group as the god flew up through the roof of the Underdark to emerge into the light of the sun. Before they spent too much time stumbling around blindly, Oadicius restored each of the group's sight in turn.

As Korth took its rightful place in the heavens, the party returned to Eris' manor. Victor dispelled the enchantment Eaton had placed on Bethany, awakening her at last. While she got some true sleep, Eris ushered the party downstairs to discuss their next move against Eaton. He had doubtless not been idle during the five's journey north and Eris expressed her concern about the progression of his plans.

In turn, the party shared their suspicion that Bethany was the lich's phylactery. Eris was able to confirm that she was in short order, necessitating finding an alternative to destroying the phylactery and Bethany with it. Back in the arms of civilization, they had the resources of Ludenwick's foremost universities at their disposal and so they set to work. It required the efforts of all four of them but, eventually, they discovered a ritual that would transfer the phylactery into a new vessel. It had four key components - five thousand gold of gems, ten thousand gold each of larkspur and rosemary, and a part of the lich's body.

Devising a plan to reach Eaton proved the most difficult of these requirements, as the demiplane in which Eris had been held captive was established to be warded against planar travel after both Victor and Yldor attempted to bridge the space. Further discussion manifested a roundabout method of intercepting the lich, namely speaking with the nightwalkers to discover the nature of Eaton's recent movements. Oadicius, with a proper offering to facilitate communication, and Flora in the form of a death knight travelled to the desolate domain of the nightwalkers. There, they learned that Eaton had been requested to return to the border between it and the Shadowfell within the next couple days on the authority of one particular nightwalker.

One other complication was the need to replicate the runes inscribed on the old vessel upon the new. Given that these symbols were carved into Bethany, the question of how to see the inscription was solved by the use of a ring of x-ray vision borrowed from a deeply harrowed Esker. Victor's keen mind ensured that they only needed to make an observation once, which Bethany agreed to. Running along her spine and ribs were a number of binding symbols, each of which Victor copied out.

Finally, Flora procured the gems while Victor looked into the herbs. Rosemary was not terribly rare but such a quantity of larkspur would be impossible to obtain with Bonavida so deep in Eaton's territory, unless they were to go straight to the source. Recalling their last brush with the druids of Bonavida, the two were confident that they were far more powerful than they had been at the time and obtaining the herb would not be much of a trial. With Oadicius and Moreen accompanying them, they teleported to the island by way of the Plane of Air, preparing to parley once more with its custodians.
