# Session 41

Oadicius availed himself of Uria's guidance and learned that Eaton kept the means to destroy the phylactery close to home. The party's course of action was clear - they would need to devise a way to reach Eaton's demiplane, which they had only glimpsed.

Without knowledge of its exact and complete contents, their only recourse was to attempt to use the finger they had taken from Eaton in place of the usual material component for plane shift. The four were certain that things would end there, one way or another, and thus made preparations for the final confrontation that awaited them.

As the restored sun rose on the surface, the adventurers departed for the demiplane. They found themselves standing before an imposing manor. Portentous black clouds darkened the skies above, casting the scenery in a malaise, and a set of double doors engraved with skulls welcomed them to the Eaton estate.

Inside, a stained glass window looked down upon the entrance hall. Two shimmering barriers covered the stairs and three doors at the cardinal directions led deeper into the manor. A withered rose was illuminated by weak light within and a spectral image rose from the shadow it cast on the floor below. Eaton welcomed his guests and bid them enter the eastern sitting room, as exploring the manor blindly would be hazardous to their health.

They did so, finding to their surprise that it was indeed not trapped or otherwise dangerous. The single window in the room looked out on a garden of decay. Rather than wait for Eaton to receive them, the party decided to investigate the east wing of the manor. A set of study rooms led to a room labelled as the eastern library; in his haste to reach it, Victor activated a spike trap. Though he was easily able to extricate himself from it, it was evident that the manor was not an exact replica of its counterpart on the material plane.

The eastern library was guarded by two statues of spellcasters which animated to defend it against the intruders, but they proved no match for the party. The remainder of the east wing contained an alchemist's laboratory, with two completed potions left on the benches.

Eventually, they reached the courtyard. Treading off the carefully maintained garden paths provoked the wrath of a corpse flower and an animate tree which both attacked the party. They then crossed to the west wing, where they discovered an office decorated with a pair of scimitars arranged atop a shield emblazoned with an eclipse and a family portrait. The portrait depicted a young Bethany and Eris with Bethany's fathers.

For the first time since arriving at the manor, Eaton's attention was drawn to the party by their presence in this room. Acrimony dripped from every word in time with the lightning outside as he warned them not to desecrate the memory of his husband. Quickly, they took a key from his desk and continued onward.

The west wing was a mirror of its counterpart, ending in another waiting room. Unlike the one to which they had been directed, corpses and rotten food adorned the room and a flameskull was trapped in a salt circle near the carnage. She entreated the party for their aid, explaining that she had been Eaton's housekeeper in life until she was killed for objecting to him poisoning his guests. Oadicius broke the line of salt, freeing her and allowing her to serve as the party's guide throughout the manor.

She recognized the key as the one for the central ballroom, though she recommended they avoid it unless necessary, as a procession of ghosts had taken up residence there. If they wanted to reach the upper floors of the manor, there was an alternate staircase through the pantry. However, when they reached it, the way upward was found to be locked by a mechanism that required two obsidian jewels to be inserted into eye sockets in the door.

Having only the ballroom key at their disposal, the four elected to continue exploring the manor. They searched several games rooms, each of which was guarded by one of Eaton's followers, until they arrived at the ballroom.

Stepping through the double doors of the central ballroom was like stepping into the past. Ill-formed ghosts drifted across the dancefloor but two sets of figures were more solid. Eris and Bethany sat in the corner, chatting amicably, while William and James Eaton danced together, lost in each other's eyes. Flora spied an obsidian orb among William's jewelry, which she immediately took measures to attempt to steal.

As she moved through the crowd, the shade of Eris intercepted her with an offer to introduce her to her uncles, which Flora accepted. She made some small talk with William while an invisible Aiyah made several unsuccessful attempts to steal the necklace. Taking pity on her, Victor intervened with a greater distraction, namely a dance with William which provided the needed opening for Aiyah.

With the obsidian eye in hand, the party excused themselves from the festivities to return to the pantry stair, ready to ascend to the next level of the manor.
