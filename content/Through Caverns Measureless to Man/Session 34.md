# Session 34

Before the party set off the next morning, Victor had a brief conversation with Flora. He confided in her that with all the party's recent involvement in romantic affairs, he had realized he held feelings for an unnamed someone. Though Victor was reluctant to let them know about it, Flora was of the opinion that since they were risking death in their pursuit of Eaton, it would be wiser to tell this person before it was too late.

Once all were ready, Oadicius cast the spell he had memorized the night before. He took the lead as the party traversed the treacherous swamp in the direction of Shatterpeak Mountain. Their path was unobstructed during their first day of travel but both Flora and Oadicius glimpsed ominous images curling through the mist.

After finishing construction of the tower and sealing the warding spells around it, Eris asked to speak with the party. She and Yldor had been in contact and he had mentioned that the party had taken an interest in reviving Korth. She cautioned them against this, with an eye on Victor in particular. He denied any interest in it, which she was unconvinced by.

Speaking further in her demiplane, away from Oadicius and Moreen, Victor capitulated. Eris explained that her warning came from her own failed attempts at the task. She was convinced that Korth's mind was far too destroyed to be meaningfully controlled in a vessel. Victor remained unconvinced, which did not sit well with Eris. However, recognizing that she could not talk him out of it, she requested that she be allowed to assist him. She did not think it could be done but the possibility of levelling Korth's power against Eaton remained an appealing one.

During her work with Yldor, they had discovered a method to speed the construction of the vessel by imbuing it with magic. It was a costly process but between herself and Victor they could expedite it to a scale of mere days. Reluctantly, Victor gave his agreement. The everburning candle he had picked up nearly a year prior in the Lifeless Archipelago figured heavily in his dreams that night.

Unlike the previous day, the party encountered another group of travelers in the swamp. A contingent of twenty shadar-kai military officers were scouring the area in search of spirit trolls which had been sighted in the vicinity of the town they protected. The party had seen no such creatures but were warned to be wary of them as they continued on. The shadar-kai also informed the party that it would be unwise of them to drink any of the water they encountered in the Shadowfel. Those who did not originate on the plane of shadow lost their memories or even knowledge of who they were upon consuming it.

Not long after parting ways with the battalion, the party encountered a spectral giant that they identified as a spirit troll. Flora ensorcelled it in a cage of magical force and sent a message to the leader of the soldiers to inform them that they had an hour to deal with the troll if they wished.

As the party was preparing to make camp, another spirit troll and a coven of hags ambushed the five adventurers in revenge for the loss of one of their own. Together, the hags wielded formidable power but the loss of one of their number reduced their threat to the party significantly, allowing them to fight off the attack without sustaining significant injuries.

It took only a half-day of travel before the town that the soldiers had originated from was visible on the horizon. It lay along the path Oadicius had divined and the party saw no harm in making a stop there along their way, given that it sat nestled at the foothills of the mountain. As they approached the town, a trio of ravens begun circling overhead. Flora suggested Victor send Paracelsus to communicate with them.

Though one of the ravens had an iridescent sheen to its feathers, they did not otherwise appear to be anything other than regular birds. They had been sent to watch the party by an unknown individual. In the knowledge that the god of the Shadowfel was called the Raven Queen, the party decided to let the birds do their work.

Despite its location, the town was mostly unremarkable aside from a small tower in the centre of town adorned with all the typical trappings of a wizard's lair. The party did some shopping and then set down for the night in Eris' tower. While the party was taking time to relax or work on their own projects, there was a knock at the door.

The wizard who lived at the conspicuous tower was offended by the presence of another tower in the town. Responding in kind, Flora annoyed them so severely that they stormed back to their tower in a huff. She followed them in order to give them a taste of their own medicine but she only succeeded in being briefly banished back to the material plane and having a pomegranate thrown at her head as she sprinted back to the tower. In his dreams that night, Oadicius recieved a message from Morin. He told Oadicius that he was fast approaching the usurper and urged him not to waste his chance to destroy him.

With the mountain range visible in the distance, the party travelled ever closer to Eaton's location. Along their way through the hills, the party encountered a creature who had once been a wizard before crossing the Raven Queen and being transformed into a birdlike form. He grumbled about being deposed by Eaton and while he was not willing to assist the party in removing him from Shatterpeak, he would be happy to return to reclaim it after Eaton's destruction.

Eventually, the party came upon a wide valley cut around the perimeter of the mountains. Several groups of denizens of the Shadowfel were patrolling the valley in groups, making it impossible to cross without being noticed. Victor masked their movements with an invisibility spell that necessitated several castings due to the length of their journey through the valley.

On the second casting, there was a noticeable surge of magic but there appeared to be no ill effects caused by it. At the foot of the mountain, the party found a small cave that had been converted into a surprisingly cozy dwelling, presumably by the nagpa they had met earlier. In light of the lateness of the hour and the magic resources that had been expended in their crossing of the valley, the party decided to rest there for the evening.

In the middle of the night, Victor woke Flora with a peculiar request - that she behead him so that he might obtain immortality. He seemed utterly convinced that this would work, indicating to Flora that he was likely under some form of malevolent charm. She attempted to modify his memory to remove the impulse, learning in the process that it had taken root after the earlier surge of magic. She concluded that there was some form of instability in the magical framework of the area but, in casting a spell to begin with, she triggered one of its strange effects herself.

Victor, who had his memory of the matter removed, was convinced that the resulting glow on his feet was Flora's idea of a prank. When he went to confront her, an argument broke out that woke up the rest of the party and cascaded into the use of more spells to attempt to deal with the situation.

In the chaos that erupted, Eris was knocked into an unconscious state by her own magic, making it clear to the party that using magic in the area would be far too dangerous. For all but Moreen and Oadicius, this would prove to be a difficult stricture to keep.
