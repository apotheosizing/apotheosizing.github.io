# Session 42

Immediately north of the stairs was a dining room, occupied by a sighing skull lord and his skeletal butler. He loudly complained about Eaton assigning tasks to all his other guests and leaving him with nothing to do. Flora entered with a sympathetic musical number and asked the skull lord about Eaton's plans, hoping to take advantage of his ambivalence. He informed the party that Eaton's allies consisted of the two vampires they had met previously, the boneclaw, and a death knight.

As he wasn't inclined to further Eaton's agenda by killing them, the party was able to leave the dining room without incident. Belle offered to direct them to Eaton's quarters on this floor, which they accepted. As they passed through the southeastern wing of the manor, they stopped in at the vampire's quarters. A man was being kept there by the vampires to serve as a source of blood and Oadicius resolved to free him by killing the vampires when they encountered them.

The party briefly doubled back to examine Eaton's office when Belle mentioned its presence in this hallway. On his desk was a single letter from his late husband, evidently sent while Eaton was away from their home. Of note was his mention of the installation of a mural in their room and the inclusion of a ivory-handled dagger named Heartrender alongside the letter. In one of the drawers, Victor found a ring of keys concealed beneath a false bottom.

With Belle's gudiance, the party proceeded to Eaton's bedroom. Their path led them across the upper loft of the entrance hall. Four armed statues were placed in this area, one of which was an iron golem that the party dealt with by using various forms of flight to avoid most of its attacks.

The master bedroom was an expansive space, with the ceiling taken up with the mural James' letter had described. It depicted the emblems of the forgotten gods and the excerpt: *It is not now as it hath been of yore; - / Turn wheresoe'er I may / By night or by day / The things which I have seen I now can see no more.* An empty display plaque proclaimed the name of the dagger Eaton had been gifted.

After some discussion, the party decided to go down to the basement by way of a secret stairway in the eastern library. In the manor's depths, they passed by a cellar to reach a crypt. Only two tombs were present in the crypt main, belonging to Eaton's parents. At the back, a statue of James overlooked his sealed coffin. His epitaph bore the same quotation as the mural above and, upon speaking it aloud, the top of the coffin moved aside to reveal the corpse within. His remains had decayed to the point of skeletonization and grasped in bony fingers was Heartrender.

Touching the dagger caused an angry howling to fill the chamber. Winds whipped around the party was a whirl of ghosts appeared, with the spirit which had inhabited the Sailor Johnson doll at its centre. As the tornado descended upon them, Victor used the dagger to destroy the phylactery, releasing the souls trapped inside it into the whirlwind. However, Moreen was able to pare them down enough for Flora to recapture the primary spirit in another doll, allowing her to dispel the remaining ghosts.

With nothing standing between them and their final confrontation with Eaton but the three floors of the manor, the four decided that they would be best served by removing any backup he might call on. Continuing through the basement, the party found James' forge and its many masterfully crafted weapons, as well as a strange fountain of pure viscous black. Flora and Oadicius recognized it as the energy that suffused the plane the nightwalkers called home and wondered how and why it had been brought to Eaton's demiplane.

At the west end of the basement, they found a dungeon with a single skeletal occupant. They claimed that they were wrongfully imprisoned for theft, a lie that held up for all of two minutes, but Flora freed them regardless, earning their loyalty. In the opposing east end, the party found two coffins that they presumed belonged to their vampiric quarries. They drove stakes into the coffins, killing Henri and laying a trap for his companion.

The party returned to the second floor of the manor to speak with the skull lord. Flora introduced the party with a musical number, ending it rather abruptly with the ultimatum to surrender or die. The skull lord surrendered, returning to his room to collect his treasures before departing.

In the previously unexplored northern rooms, the party encountered the vampire Natalia and several vampire spawn. Though she wielded magical power in addition to her supernatural powers, the party was able to defeat her, forcing her to return to her coffin and thus her doom.

Likewise, they met the arcknight Sera, the death knight they had been warned of, nearby. She challenged Moreen to a single combat, which Moreen gladly accepted. Sera's opening moves failed to put a scratch on the fighter and, by contrast, Moreen unleashed a flurry of sword strikes in a show of peerless martial prowess that cut the death knight down in the space of a breath.

Though every moment that passed meant that Eaton had the opportunity to prepare for their arrival in kind, the party took an hour to prepare themselves for what awaited them at the top of the manor - the end of their journey together.
