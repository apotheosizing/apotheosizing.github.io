# Session 43

The uppermost floor of the manor played host to an observatory. A massive telescope dominated the space, surrounded by an illusion of the skies. Eaton's final line of defense - the last of his boneclaws - barred the party's path, a blazing hatred in its eyes that had been absent from those of the prior five.

Combat began immediately, with the party attempting to strike a balance between quickly eliminating the boneclaw as chanting began to emanate through the western door and conserving their resources for the coming confrontation. The matter was complicated by Victor's discovery that a demilich inhabited the bowels of the telescope, but as the words of the ritual grew louder, the party redoubled their efforts to slay these obstacles. For the final time, Moreen incanted a prayer to Torkan and struck a blow that ended the unnatural life of one of Eaton's boneclaws.

Barely stopping for a breath, the party barreled through the door to the site of Eaton's ritual. They unleashed a barrage of spells and steel which went utterly ignored as Eaton finished his summoning. A luminous darkness poured from the circle, enveloping the lich as he declared that they were once again too late to prevent his plans from coming to fruition. In the next instant, he was gone.

Upon closer examination, Victor recognized the design of the circle as matching one of the first teleportation sequences he had memorized - the one that sat in the basement of Rosewood manor. The four adventurers gave chase, transversing the planes to find themselves in the ruins of Eris' home. From its corpse had risen the massive form of a nightwalker that could only be the figure of the legend Silk had recounted in Bonehaven. It stalked down the streets, each mere footstep bringing destruction.

Eris, who stood dazed in the chaos, returned to herself at the appearance of the party and teleported them to the relative safety of the Silent Palace. They explained what they had learned and accomplished in Eaton's demiplane to her as the five made their way to the throne room to speak with the queen.

Once they had been informed of what transpired, both queen and consort launched into preparations to make a final stand at the palace with the assistance of the party. Using the power vested in Ichor, the queen had the ability to bolster and protect the party from the sheer antithesis of life that was the nightwalker king. She used a modicum of its magic to restore the party to fighting fitness, breaking her vow of silence to utter the spell.

Through the flurry of activity, Flora noticed Eris' distraction. She made an attempt to improve her spirits before the battle and learned in the process that the source of her diversion was witnessing Bethany's death at the hands of the nightwalker king. Flora assured her that she would be able to restore her once they emerged victorious, just as Flora herself had been.

Only minutes passed between the assembly of Ludenwick's last line of defense and the arrival of the nightwalker king but they stretched infinitely in the anxious silence that had fallen over the courtyard. Then, beneath Morin's barrier, the final confrontation began.

The nightwalker king was joined by Eaton, who had delayed a moment to restore the magical wards  that had been broken in his brief encounter with the party in the demiplane. The party focused their efforts on the earthbound god, hoping to banish it back whence it came before it did any more irreparable harm. In the process, Victor was overwhelmed by the darkness that emanated from the king. But, in the precious moments before his soul was obliterated, Eris called down a miracle to restore him to life.

Sheer persistence eventually brought down the nightwalker king, who faded with one final pulse of negative energy. As it had been so many times previous, the party stood face-to-face with Eaton. Between Eris, Flora, and Victor, they were able to dispel most of his spells before they could take hold, allowing Moreen and Oadicius to weaken him. In one final push, Oadicius called upon the aid of Uria to strike Eaton down once and for all. She heeded his call and the lich, scourge of the Underdark, shackler of the sun, was turned to naught but dust by the wrath of the goddess he had so long defied.

It took a moment for the reality of what had occurred to set in. The queen, utterly exhausted from channeling the power of Ichor, was escorted to a place where she could rest as soon as it was clear that they were now safe, though not before the crown prince offered his thanks to the party for their assistance.

The victory was a bitter one for Eris, who knew that Eaton had been warped into an existential threat by his own hand and yet had still been her uncle. She collected his ashes and parted ways with the party, finding it difficult to partake in their triumph.

Flora, Moreen, Oadicius, and Victor made their next stop a tavern, where they drunk to their accomplishment and - once the fact that this chapter of their lives had ended began to truly set in - discussed what they planned to do next.

Moreen, of course, had an interrupted wedding to rectify and extended invitations once again to the rest of the party. Flora, in recent possession of an apparatus of the crab, intended to explore the Dark Seas with Aiyah once she had been placed into a humanoid body. Oadicius, for his part, offered to assist Flora in constructing a mechanical form for Aiyah but his own ambitions were to aid Ludenwick in rebuilding and to restore his brother to life. Victor was long overdue for a trip home to have an even longer delayed discussion with Henry, though he could hardly let Flora go tearing off into the uncharted ocean alone.

Their festivities were sobered by a message from Eris, who informed them that she would be interring Eaton in his family's crypt the following night and sought their presence. A day later, they stood in the garden of the house on which Eaton had modelled the demiplane as Eris and a recently revived Bethany made the final preparations for the funerary service - namely a means prepared by Esker to prevent anyone from raising Eaton from death.

As the ashes were sealed beneath the earth, Bethany said a few words. Like Eris, she found herself torn between the simultaneous truths that Eaton had done truly monstrous deeds and the fact that for many years of her life he had been a loving father to her. However, she hoped that they might emerge from the dark shadow he cast over the Underdark toward a brighter future.

In the years that followed, Bethany's hope did indeed come to pass. Ludenwick, with Oadicius' assistance, slowly rebuilt and repopulated, though it never fully recovered from the events of that tumultuous year. Queen Severina succumbed to the complications of wielded unmitigated the power of Moren, leaving her son Caius to assume the throne and lead the city forward.

As for our heroes' allies, Bethany and Eris left behind the Underdark and Eaton's complicated legacy for the Surface, where they established new lives for themselves. Yldor joined the party in their delves into the mysteries beneath the waves while Yrsa re-established the worship of the Drowned Crow as Ludenwick once again found its footing. Esker, inspired by the constant cloying presence of Flora, created his magnum opus - an item that prevented any form of location or communication - and retired to a quiet spot on the Surface. Rachel and the crew of the Black Waltz, no longer under contract with Eris, reclaimed their position as the scourge of the Dark Seas with the addition of a new crewmember, one Ezra the Fleet.

Though the exploits of the heroes of Ludenwick continued, it was for these events that they were chiefly remembered. To this day, in the courtyard where the climactic clash occurred, a statue commissioned by King Caius Iulius Tactius commemorates their defeat of the most potent threat the Underdark ever faced.
