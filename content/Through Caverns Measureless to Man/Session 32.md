# Session 32

Although the culprit had the upper hand, Moreen and Oadicius gave chase. The culprit nearly made it to the doors of the palace before Moreen landed a hit against them, causing them to crumple into a pile of snow. Oadicius surmised that the culprit had been a simulacrum but its melted state left little to be divined about whom it was based on.

Eris, who had followed the pair as quickly as she was able, sifted through the snow to find the lock of hair that had been used to create the simulacrum. Using it as a focal point, Oadicius attempted to scry on the person whom the hair was taken from to no avail. Even Morin, communed with by Oadicius, could not determine the identity of the simulacrum. Moreen was able to determine that the lock appeared to be at least six months old, meaning that it could have been gathered from an unsuspecting individual for use by the true culprit later.

Despite the attack, Bella Dryden was determined for the salon to continue. Assured that Eris was receiving further medical care, Moreen and Oadicius returned to the event. A few of the guests had left, including the potential suspect Illya Malkova, but those who remained had a lively conversation about the merits and disappointments of the previous night's entertainment.

Afterwards, the party reconvened in their rooms and exchanged information. The party examined the equipment that the simulacrum had been given, determining that the sword was poisoned. Discussion about the possible identities of the true culprit did not get very far until Eris arrived, having had her slashed throat mended. She gave an account of what had transpired before the attack, explaining that the simulacrum had struck just after Lady Amber had informed her of James Murdoch's potential connections to Eaton.

Crucially, she could provide information both about James Murdoch and those in the court who would be capable of creating a simulacrum. James was Lady Summerstep's assistant. His family had once held a noble title but it had been stripped from them in response to accusations of treason. However, they were favoured by the queen and had kept much of their status in the court.

As Eris made to retire to her rooms, feeling weary from her ordeal, she collapsed. Realizing that the healing she had received had not neutralized the poison from the blade she had been attacked with, Oadicius did so only moments after she lost consciousness. Removing the poison from her system restored her to consciousness, prompting the party to identify the poison. Eris was able to provide information about its effects but not its name or manufacturers.

Calling upon their connections with Ezra, the party learned that the poison was known as Death's Kiss. It was not manufactured even by apothecaries unless under special order. They knew only one individual, other than themself, who was able to concoct it - a tiefling named Medusa who operated in Upper Ghostspire. They were willing to take the party to meet with him, as they would need their assistance to navigate the dust-choked streets of the district.

With a substantial bribe greasing the wheels, Medusa provided the information that the group sought. His last order of Death's Kiss had been made six months ago - a fact that did not escape the notice of the party - and had been picked up by James Murdoch. However, the order itself had been placed by Lady Olwen Summerstep. 

Little more was needed to incriminate Lady Summerstep but the degree of Murdoch's involvement remained unclear. Eris noted that Lady Summerstep did not treat Murdoch well, having some form of blackmail against him that kept him as her assistant despite the poor treatment, making it possible he had done all this under duress.

Eris and the party went to speak with James, who seemed utterly confused about their line of questioning. To all appearances, his confusion was sincere, leading the party to speculate that someone may have impersonated him during the transaction with Medusa. Flora suggested that his memories might have been altered, having once learned the spell to do so herself. An identification of magic surrounding James revealed that he had indeed had his memories tampered with.

His girlfriend, who had been present throughout the interrogation, was able to cast the spell required to undo the modifications, restoring his memories much to James' horror. Lady Illya Malkova had created the simulacrum in the image of her husband Gereon in collaboration with Lady Summerstep but this was not the most ruinous of their crimes. The three had been in contact with Eaton, acting as his agents for the theft from the royal vault.

Flora wasted no time in informing the queen, sending a message to her directly in anticipation of their arrival to the throne room. James was willing to cooperate with the investigation and accompany the party to provide a full testimony to the queen. By the time the group reached the throne room, the full force of the queensguard had been mustered in preparation for the arrest of the traitors.

James' information was sufficient for the queen, who ordered the Malkovas and the Summersteps be brought before her for an opportunity to confess. The game was up and the traitors did not resist, though they were not especially cooperative with the interrogation conducted by the queen consort. Only Illya Malkova confessed, in the hope that it would earn her a lighter sentence than execution. She confirmed that Eaton's goal had been the dagger that was the twin of his glaive and admitted that they had been acting as his instruments long before the planning of the heist.

A confession was all the was needed for the traitors to be taken away to await the day of their sentencing. The queen furnished the party with her thanks and offered them great rewards for their help. Flora was given an apparatus of war that the party could wield against Eaton, Moreen received an ornate sceptre from the treasury, and Victor chose to keep his claim to a reward for later use. Oadicius waived his reward in exchange for assurances that the arrow would be protected.

In the lull of activity that followed, Moreen sought the perfect ring for her upcoming proposal to her lady love. She had been waiting to find the right gift to present as part of her request and the sceptre was appropriately lavish for the task. A teleportation circle had been laid down in palace of Saut, which would allow the party to make the journey to the castle in moments rather than months. Thus, once the preparations were complete, the party would be bound for Saut.
