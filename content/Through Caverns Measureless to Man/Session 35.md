# Session 35

After some sleep and discussion, the party determined that ritual magic would be safe enough due to its prolonged casting process. Oadicius and Victor were able to identify the wild magic effects that afflicted Eris and Victor. Victor's was harmless enough that there was no need to risk the cascade of removing it but Eris' would last two days they didn't have the ability to spend.

Oadicius chanced a dispel magic, managing to avoid triggering a surge and awakening Eris. Growing weary of the strange environment of the mountainside, the party sought to find Eaton under the assumption that he would ward his lair against the unkempt magic of the Shadowfel. Higher up the mountain, a stone door had been left partially open, leading in to what Eris knew to be Eaton's laboratory.

Paracelsus went in first to scout the premises. The cavern entrance led to a fork in the path, one of which led to a closed door and the other to a set of stairs guarded by two elves wielding spears. He would risk detection by going any further and so returned to the party with the information he'd gathered.

The party chose to go toward the stairs and were attacked almost at once by the elves. When one of them bit Moreen in the struggle, their true vampiric nature was revealed. Even without the radiant blade of Torkan's Justice, the party was able to deal with the vampires without much difficulty. Behind the vampires was the apprentice's room, a large circular room that had collected a layer of dust from disuse. It was empty aside from a child's toy and a drawing done by a much younger Bethany of her and Eris.

Returning to the sealed stone door, the party entered the former training room. They were able to replenish their spell components from the supplies within and pick up several tuning forks that would allow them to travel across the planes. The other notable feature of the room was a door sealed with a password. While Victor was in the process of magically identifying the password, the party tried a few combinations before landing on Bethany's name which proved to be the correct passphrase.

Flora recognized the room, as Bethany lay unconscious on the stone slab just as she had during her scry. Eris ran to her side only to be repelled by a magic barrier, slamming into the opposite wall with significant force. However, the party was able to bypass her imprisonment thanks to Oadicius creating an antimagic field. Bethany woke at once, confused by her presence in the Shadowfel but recognizing most of the party. After being informed of what had happened, she agreed to come with them as they explored the laboratory.

Moreen's wraith passed through the south wall of the training room, finding a skeletal dragon resting on the other side among a horde of bones. Flora painted a door through for the party, drawing the dragon's ire. Although it had once been a mighty dragon, the party was able to defeat it and proceed forward. The cavern had been carved into another room beyond the dragon, housing piles of bones and two giant skeletal creatures, who posed little threat in comparison to the dragon.

A chamber filled with darkness that magical light could not illuminate stretched out across the next portion of the cavern. As the party moved through it, they were accosted by shadowy figures that drained their strength. Fortunately, the four were able to kill the creatures before Flora and Victor were killed by the weakness they inflicted.

Back in the light, the party found a circular chamber open to the sky above where a blue orb sat atop a raised dias. Both Bethany and Eris recognized it at once as a dangerous artifact Eaton had been studying for many years. They cautioned the party against approaching it, as the last person they'd known to do so was Bethany's father who had died in doing so. It resisted Flora's attempt to pick it up with mage hand but Oadicius was able to touch it with no adverse effects.

He decided to attune to the orb, which would require enough time that the antimagic field keeping Bethany awake would fade. While he did so, Eris determined which tuning fork would allow travel back to the Material Plane and used it to send Bethany to safety. Once she was gone, Victor asked Eris about the death of Bethany's father, which she recounted as the event that her sorcerous powers originated from.

During the attunement process, a heavy wave of nausea overtook Oadicius but he endured the unpleasantness until the hour was up. He knew then that it was an artifact of Uria, as his contact with the orb had drawn her attention. He was not a cleric of Uria but she bestowed her blessing on him in honour of the long-standing alliance between herself and Morin. 

With the orb in hand, the party continued deeper into the cavern until they reached a door carved with the foreboding word *welcome*. Moreen threw it open to a chilling sight. Standing over a circle of blood and wearing a holy symbol of Torkan, the final word of the summoning ritual he had been incanted fell from Eaton's lips with a laugh of triumph. A portal opened beneath him, calling forth a creature from beyond - a nightwalker. It absorbed the light around it, twisting and destroying it completely. Eaton proclaimed that the party had witnessed the beginning of the end. Soon, he would march upon the world and the gods with an army of nightwalkers.

Guarded by both the final boneclaw and the summoned nightwalker, even reaching Eaton proved to be an ordeal. The boneclaw was the first to fall, though Torkan's Justice was no longer capable of destroying it permanently, and Oadicius was able to banish the nightwalker back into the darkness. In retaliation, Eaton called down a hail of meteors, breaking Oadicius' concentration on the banishment and killing Victor outright.

Eaton turned his attention to Eris, who between the meteor swarm and the other dangers of the battle was killed in his next attack. He took the opportunity to teleport away from the battle, taking her corpse with him. All that remained was the nightwalker. Though it was subordinate to Eaton, it was no lesser threat. In its final moments, it lashed out at Flora, felling the third member of the party. Moreen was able to slay it moments later, but she was moments too late.

Oadicius was able to restore Victor to life but Flora's soul did not respond to the same summons. Confused, he called upon Uria using the orb. She told him that nightwalkers were beings whose very existence was antithetical to life and destroyed all possibility of life with their touch. Thus, though Flora's soul was willing to return, her body was no longer capable of hosting life. With Eris' body taken and Flora's life snuffed out by anything short of a miracle, the three who remained were at a loss for how to proceed.
