# Session 38

After a long but not especially treacherous day of sailing, the party reached the unmapped northern shore of the Dark Seas. Unlike Yldor and Yrsa, the party had neglected to bring appropriate attire for cold weather travel and had to make do by travelling on creatures created by Flora's bag of tricks. The far reaches of the tundra were devoid of any life but that did not mean their journey was without obstacle.

As the six made their way through the valley between two mountains, the roar of a distant creature triggered an avalanche. There was little chance of outrunning the rapid onslaught of snow but the party was able to reach safety through the use of magic and magic items, with the exception of Moreen who ended up buried beneath the snow. Fortunately, she was able to dig herself out before she suffered any ill effects from the cold. Victor was able to identify the roar as belonging to a roc but there were no signs of such a creature for the remainder of the day.

The closer the party journeyed to their destination, the more strangely certain members of the group were behaving. Aiyah and Victor were the most consistently affected by hallucinations and other oddities but Moreen and Yrsa came under similar effects on occasion.

On the third night of their journey, Flora and Moreen spotted the presence of an onlooker to their makeshift camp. What appeared to be a hill with eyes in the night was revealed to be a white dragon by daylight, which Flora discovered by nearly getting her arm bit off by her. Keen to reduce their travel time, Flora offered the dragon, Nondess, a king's ransom in diamonds which she conjured with the mightiest magic in existence - wish.

Satisfied, Nondess took the party some ways closer to the location of Korth's corpse. She advised the party that approaching the corpse was more a matter of reaching the state of mind required encounter it rather than any concrete destination as she departed. Fortunately, the continued deterioration of several of the party's number was enough to bring them into contact with Korth the next evening.

As Flora had seen in her scrying, Korth was a massive creature, stretching far beyond the horizon. Wounds which had not healed for thousands of years still festered and its unwavering eye was kept on the party as they made their preparations for healing it. Yldor suggested that the alchemical formulas he had been developing might be able to heal the body, which would in turn help to restore its mind. Oadicius, contrarily, was certain that nothing could be done without mending Korth's soul. While Flora and Victor assisted Yrsa and Yldor, he asked Uria about the state of Korth's soul. It had been torn apart, half of it wandering while the other half remained in the fallen corpse.

The party laboured long into the night, preparing doses of the alchemical solution until they were confident that they had enough to heal most of the body's visible wounds. In the morning, they would begin their work in earnest.

Lead by Yldor, the ritual began at first light. He cautioned the party that what they hoped to accomplish had never been done and thus there could be any number of consequences. Through the contribution of either magical power or lifeforce, each member of the party - other than Flora and Oadicius who held back most of their wells of magic in the event someone required healing - contributed to the task. At the conclusion of the ritual, all those who had participated felt a wrenching pain as Korth came to a more complete awareness.

Despite accomplishing what they had intended to do, Korth's soul remained in tatters. It let out a horrible scream of pain that knocked four of the six into unconsciousness. Oadicius was able to restore everyone to consciousness but the spellcasters had exhausted their reserves and would be useless in a fight. It seemed the only option was to flee. However, Moreen found another solution. Calling upon Torkan's light, she created a ray of daylight centered on the body, offering some measure of comfort and relief to the god. This gesture settled Korth enough that the immediate danger had passed, allowing the party to consider their next steps.

By communing with Morin, Oadicius was able to learn that the wandering fragment of Korth's soul could be found in the Shadowfel. Morin reminded Oadicius that though the restoration of Korth full soul would soothe many of its wounds, it would not heal them all.

After some discussion, the party decided that they would return to Eaton's lair in the Shadowfel, in the hopes he might have encountered the soul during his time there. Yrsa and Yldor would remain with Korth, providing a teleportation circle that the party could use to return to them once they had found the soul. Before they departed, Moreen sacrificed her ability to manifest Torkan's light to create a small orb of sunlight that remained at Korth's side, ensuring that the siblings would be safe in their absence.

Among Eaton's notes, the party did indeed discover reference to a wailing soul that swept through the mountains, afflicting those nearby with nightmares of drowning. According to information he had gathered from the town, the creature appeared periodically but unpredictably. The party resigned themselves to the idea of waiting for the soul to appear and turned their attention to the matter of retrieving Eris. They were unable to contact her in her sleeping state, leading them to conclude that she was being kept on another, unknown plane. However, unlike the last time they had attempted to devise a plan to rescue Eris, Flora, realizing that she would now be able to take them to the plane on which Eris was being kept with the power of wish, immediately did so.

Eris was unguarded, so it was a simple matter to pick her up and have Oadicius use plane shift to return them to Eaton's lair. After filling Eris in on the events that had taken place since they had parted, she concluded that she would likely be able to sense the proximity of Korth's soul due to her affinity for the Shadowfel. In the absence of any knowledge about how much time they might have, the party began to discuss means to hold the soul, considering various vessels and spells of which they might avail themselves.
