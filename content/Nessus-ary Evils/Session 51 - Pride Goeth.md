# Session 51

In the shadow of the Iron Tower, the party went thankfully unnoticed by the officers of the curfew, as the small trickle of departing devils of rank being conveniently overlooked their transgressions helped to obfuscate them. The doors to the tower were firmly closed - an oddity for any building in the Nine Hells - but Mircea was able to use passwall to sidestep the possibility of alarms around the entrance.

Within, the tower was completely silent. The party cautiously ventured into the lower levels, surmizing that their opportunity to rescue Tamsyn would evaporate the moment they stepped into Titivilus' office. The cells of the Iron Tower were occupied by an eclectic group of people. Tamsyn was one but a number of devils and a handful of more humanoid individuals, as well as a dog, were held there.

None of the cells had doors and Tamsyn in particular was unconscious, preventing any teleportation magic from affecting her. Nox guessed that she was under the effect of a sopporific drug rather than any curse. This method was clever in its mundanity, as magical sleep was by far the more easily dealt with condition. Simply disintegrating the bars or blowing them apart were options but the party decided against them out of concern that they would alert some manner of security system, even though they had surpressed the wards over the area.

As they continued to puzzle over the matter, Apollo's attention was caught by the weird sensation of a hand on his wrist. He looked over the prisoners with his truesight, suspecting that one of them might be responsible. He noticed that the Tower's one celestial prisoner had a plain humanoid form, making the disguise a confusing choice for this plane. He attempted to speak with them and learned that they were named Ortephon and came from the plane of Gleam but they refused to tell him more as apparently Titivilus enjoyed using false faces and escape attempts to trick information out of the prisoners. Even when Marica used an earth elemental form to could move through the stones of the prison and retrieve first Tamsyn, then Ortephon and the dog (whom she suspected might be a fae like the one in Halidor's custody), they remained reticent.

Marica recalled that she had sensed the influence of Gleam on herself and Apollo back on Cania and, in the hope of learning more about it, suggested the party bring Ortephon with them. Besides, they needed someone to carry Tamsyn who wouldn't be needed for the investigation into Titivilus' rooms. Ortephon agreed to do so.

Not wanting to spend more time freeing the other prisoners, the party headed to the upper eschelons of the Tower. Mircea had the misfortune of being familiar with the way and took the lead, minimizing the time the party needed to spend searching for their destination. Using Titivilus' passphrase, they were able to pass the threshold without any ill-effect. Contrary to expectation, Titivilus' office was sparse to the point of being empty of anything other than a desk. A few scattered reports and letters sat open on the desktop but the party ignored them entirely and searched for anything concealed, correctly guessing that Titivilus wouldn't leave anything incriminating out so carelessly. A secret panel in the wall revealed a small safe with a number of letters written in a strange glyph-cipher and a single letter written in Infernal. Reading through the letter made it clear that it was intended for Şenkă. The statement that Titivilus had encountered Mircea for the first time implied that they had been in contact for some time.

While they considered this, Ortephon alerted the party that someone was approaching the office. Luckily for them, it was Vassago, whose true name they all possessed. The party was able to immediately subdue him and eliminate the risk of discovery, though his mere presence likely meant that Titivilus was not far behind.

This proverbial smoking gun of Titivilus' correspondence didn't sit well with the party, however, since there was seemingly no reason for this particular letter to be easily readable. Marica figured that it may have been prior to the development of the glyph-cipher and thus by necessity written plainly but its continued presence in Titivilus' possession was suspect. Looking more carefully within the compartment revealed not just one but three additional hidden safes successively hidden in the wall. The last of these contained a small marble that the party wasn't initially able to identify the purpose of until it occured to them that it could be the component for an imprisonment.

Mircea, having access to the magical reserves of one of the greatest wizards in known history, was able to dispel the imprisonment without complication. From the marble emerged a disheveled person who introduced themself as Coryander. The party asked how they had come to be trapped in the marble and they explained that in an ancient age they had been First Warlock of Dis. Their familiar, Titivilus, had managed to usurp their position but never being one to waste a potential resource, he imprisoned them rather than killing them. Coryander was not surprised to hear about Titivilus' rise to the position of functional archdux of the plane in the intervening centuries, knowing very well how cunning he could be.

Surely the fate of their missing warlock would be evidence enough to turn Dispater against Titivilus. They made to bring it to his attention immediately but were barred by the devil himself - and Lord Titivilus had no intention of any of what had happened here reach his archdux's ear.
