# Session 45

Shortly after the battle was joined, Marica struck down one of the crew of *Compass Rose* - a white abishai who had flown over as part of the advance guard. This drew the ire of both the first mate and the captain, drawing them into the battle proper.

The other member of the advance guard, evidently someone who was very close to the slain abishai, was incapacitated by the loss of his friend, and Apollo and Nox dealt with the strange doglike creatures that accompanied them. A quartet of nergaliids operated the ballistae but the missed almost all of their shots, leaving only two real opponents for the party. Unfortunately for them neither Captain Lohengrin nor their first mate Isabel were ineffective combatants.

Once they were within earshot, Marica and Nox attempted to open negotiations with the captain. On Lohengrin’s side, their main obstacle was an irate Iz who point-blank refused to parlay with people who killed members of her crew. For their own part, Mircea - who had been busy climbing the main mast of *Satisfaction* to set up a skystrike and fending off a surprise reappearance from Tangie in the form of an imp on Lohengrin’s ship - interrupted the conversation by adding three more deaths for *Compass Rose* to the toll.

For a moment, everyone present was certain that hostilities were about to recommence save one. Lohengrin, in a show of surprising forbearance (apparently motivated by a lack of real love for the newly dead and a blasé attitude toward reincorporation of souls to the rivers), kept things civil. They invited the adventurers and Salome aboard to discuss terms of a ceasefire over a meal.

For a sailing ship, *Compass Rose*’s dining room was well-appointed. It was comparable to the one the party had seen in the Saltkeep excepting its size. The meal was quite awkward between a fuming Iz and Lohengrin offhandedly remarking on the likely demise of everyone in Avernus within earshot of Salome.

Nox was the one to formally open the discussion of blood money for the dead. Lohengrin seemed more interested in the party’s motivations for coming to Stygia. The party loosely explained Glasya’s goals and indicated they had been sent on her behalf to forge an alliance with Levistus. Lohengrin was not convinced by merely their word on the matter, prompting Mircea to cast a spell to enforce their truthfulness. Nox was the only one to escape its influence.

Once they had insurance that the party were indeed empowered to speak for Glasya, Lohengrin admitted that Stygia was one of their more obvious allies, being one of two archduxes to raise rebellions that merited punishment. That very fact was their greatest weakness, however, as Lohengrin explained that the plane was in the midst of the slow process of tearing itself to pieces. Only a few key holdings of the archdux - what Lohengrin called locuses of desire, prized by Levistus for holding old regrets and thwarted dreams - served as the lynchpins of Stygia. Until things were stabilized, they could make no real promises of assistance. The party attempted to question Lohengrin further about these locuses but were swiftly cut off by Iz.

Since it was clear the party’s direct aid would either be ineffective or unwelcome, they offered to put Lohengrin in touch with their other sworn ally: Cania. Of course, Mephistopheles’ support had not yet been secured but Nox was able to lie about the conditional agreement set down by the duke consort to make it seem otherwise. Lohengrin was immediately interested, claiming that Cania’s arcane knowledge had the potential to be the most significant outside help available to Stygia. They quickly adjourned the meeting to allow themself time to think over the matter in private. The party was offered quarters on *Compass Rose* in which to recover while Lohengrin was deliberating, which they declined to return to *Satisfaction*.

On their way out, Iz emphasized that if she heard the faintest whisper of a word of Stygia’s weakness as described by Lohengrin, she would not hesitate to make them regret trading on the information. The group, two of whom were in very rough shape after the battle and wanted nothing more than their promised rest, quickly agreed. Iz grumbled about the possibility of an alliance with Mephistopheles, claiming that if Lohengrin got to chance to escape Stygia - particularly to Cania - they would never return. This was said with the implied subtext that the party better do everything in their power to keep Lohengrin on the plane. Before the party could make head or tails of the situation, she swept out of the room after her captain.
