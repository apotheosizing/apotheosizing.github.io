# Session 64

After some discussion, the party decided that it would be simplest to return to Avernus just after they had last left it. Not only would this allay any concerns about crossing their own paths, it would afford them some time to deal with any complications that arose from their new actions in the past, or in the future they would soon visit. Apollo flew the group back to Quintestra to reunite with Artemy, Calanthir, and Jezebel.

There, Eludecia moved them to mere moments after the party had used Avernus' teleportation circle to reach Glasya's demesne of Proscenium. Much like the confusion caused by their unexpected appearance in Maladomini, there was some initial turbulence during their arrival but the summoned Lilith smoothed this over with her subordinates without issue. She asked if there was anything the followers of the Fivefold Queen could do for them and the party seized the opportunity to ensure the sanctity of the timeline. When Apollo contacted her via sending in a few weeks, she would need to deliver the news of Avernus' fall. Although she was puzzled by the matter she agreed to do as they asked without asking questions - one benefit of giving orders to a career military officer.

Apollo would required rest before taking on his draconic form, meaning that the party had a day to themselves. While most of the group prepared for the encounter ahead, Nox pulled Apollo aside to ask for a favour. He asked him to cast *legend lore* to discover the history of Apollodorus. Unfortunately however her life and exploits had not yet made the mark on the fabric of history that they would when the party's great deeds became public knowledge in later years. Nox was characteristically undeterred and so he drew upon the most knowledgeable resource at his disposal: her twin.

Artemy was reluctant at first to speak on the subject of his sister, with the wound of her death still raw on his face, but Nox was the person with whom he had his oldest remaining relationship and he found himself recounting stories of her escapades before long. Polly was the instigator of many misadventures of their youth and even the catalyst for his contract with the archdux Fierna following her own with Glasya. It was clear that he'd loved her deeply.

Once he had exhausted his well of recollection Artemy went to sleep, feeling in better spirits than he had since his sister's untimely death. Nox, however, did not. In the quiet of the party's shared rooms he began composing a ballad that weaved together the grand tale of Apollodorus' life. Just as his companions stirred he put the finishing touches on the piece.

Before they embarked Nox performed the song for the first time for a mere audience of six. Artemy was taken entirely off-guard by such a touching gesture and, so they say, this was the fateful moment that changed things between them.

With renewed spirits the party set out for the Sepulchre Pits. As Apollo sped across the empty skies of Avernus, they were unexpectedly intercepted by a man astride a wyrmling. He introduced himself as Abel, apparently a bounty hunter seeking to aid them. Although his story didn't quite add up the party saw no reason to reject the aid of a capable fighter and Nox saw in his bravado something of a kindred spirit. Thus the party numbered eight when they came to the grave of the angel Harut.

Strange black monuments littered the approach to the water, resembling twisted ambulatory forms that had either been only partially formed before being abandoned or had been destroyed so completely that the concepts they represented were lost. Among these waited three revenant angels of Zariel's contingent called back from oblivion to serve as mouthpieces of the Liege of the Nine. The tripartite warned the party that destroying Harut would engender consequences that they could not bear. They were unmoved by the god's threat and made to cut through the angels to Harut.

These members of Zariel's invading force held the line. They fought with the strength of dozens of warriors and had none of the celestial mercy that might once have softened their blows. As the battle raged and the party flagged Harut struck Artemy dead like his sister before him. Mircea reached him just as he fell and called his soul back to his body to no avail... but he was not yet willing to let Fierna take what she was owed. For the first time since he had renounced his oath to the Morninglord, he prayed for the god's intercession. Against all expectation, Artemy took another breath. Nox helped him to his feet and he rallied to banish one of the angels from the battlefield.

Jezebel too came a hair's breadth from death at the hands of the angels but thanks to Abel's assistance and Mircea's healing they were able to avoid another casualty. When the last of the angels was destroyed the party moved to engage Harut, the embodiment of the promise between a god and its angel which would destabilize the Nine Hells forever with its destruction.
