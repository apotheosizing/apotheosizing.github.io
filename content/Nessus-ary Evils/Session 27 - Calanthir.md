# Session 27
With the intention of accepting Nymil's offer, the party had time to kill in the Fortress of Memories. All of them spent time at the library, consulting the Shadowfel's records rather than the heavily regulated collections of the Nine Hells.

Daaé researched the languages of Hamarfae and Sicani. According to the archives, Hamarfae was an initial dialect of elves on the Material Plane derived from Sylvan. Sicani was a more recent language developed for formal and diplomatic speech during the Days of Myth. They were confident that Sicani was the language being spoken in their dreams.

Mircea found a copy of the writings of Saint Vepar on the nature of the gods' relationships with their followers, detailing a different perspective on the matter than Kara Krasendel's writings.

Nox continued his readings on the Whispered One and the Raven Queen. Information on the Whispered One was notably limited but there were a profusion of works available on the Raven Queen - including Daaé's compilation of myths. Apollo, taking a page from his father's book, attempted to research Blackrazor but due to its status as a lost relic, not much reliable scholarship existed on the sword.

The party reconvened at Daaé's home, where Nymil had prepared dinner. He inquired after the party's adventures and expressed his sympathies about Shrike's death. Unlike their last visit, the spectre of Kas did not darken their windows and the party woke the next morning well-rested.

The Raven Queen created a portal to Minauros for the adventurers and they picked up where they left off with the resurrection ritual. This time, Virgil called down the soul of Calanthir and life was breathed back into Shrike's body. Disoriented by their unexpected revival, Calanthir attacked the party, but they were greatly weakened from the ordeal and thus easily subdued.

Once things were under control, the adventurers spoke to Calanthir in order to gauge where they stood with someone who was essentially a stranger. The details were hazy, but they did remember a majority of their time as Shrike, as well as knowing whatever it was that they had forgotten at the River Lethe.

They demanded the return of the chalice, which Nox reluctantly agreed to. It was evident that they were not as friendly as Shrike had been with the party and they indicated that they did not trust them to the same degree their previous incarnation had. Nevertheless, they were willing to remain with the party for the time being.

Calanthir would require at least four days of recovery to be fighting fit but the party did not have many contacts in Minauros. Apollo called upon Alston for hospitality. He was happy to hear from him after so long and arranged rooms for them for several days in a rather expensive area of Abrymoch.

As they no longer had pressing time constraints, the party decided it was best to travel to Avernus to formalize the alliances Nox and Mircea had forged before making their way to Malbolge.

Both of them received commendations from Vortigern, including a promotion for Nox as he was the only one formally enrolled in the military. He immediately delegated the task of commanding his cohort to Haagenti, the logistics officer Apollo had spoken with.

Leaning on their recent contributions to the war effort, the party was able to take advantage of expedited travel to Avernus' teleportation circle and reach the city of Proscenium before the week was out.
