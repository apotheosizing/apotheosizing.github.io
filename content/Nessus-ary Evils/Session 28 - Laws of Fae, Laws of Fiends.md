# Session 28
Proscenium, the seat of Glasya's power, shone. Every building appeared to give off its own light and none more so than the fortress of Osseia to the south. The party stepped out of the teleportation bureau into a conflict between a group of fae and a group of devils.

The party questioned the devils on the matter and they explained that the right to rule the plane as a whole was in question. One of the fae shouted across the divide that their claim to Malbolge sprung from the former archdux Malaphas - a night hag. The devils countered that she had long been killed by Glasya, who now ruled the plane by right of the greater power.

Having found themselves promising to assist Glasya previously, the party aided the devils in defeating the fae, earning their gratitude. The leader of the group told the adventurers that they were agents of Halidor, the very devil the party had been asked to sabotage. They extended an invitation to Halidor's eponymous tavern which the party eagerly accepted.

At the back of the bar, Halidor was awaiting their arrival. She welcomed them to her establishment and asked the party why they had aided her. Nox insisted that any loyal devil would have done the same. They expressed an interest in further driving back the fae as they encroached on her territory and Halidor saw no reason not to make use of their services.

She told the adventurers that a grove lay at the heart of Proscenium. Stories were conflicting on the date of its appearance, it had either been there since Malaphas' reign or had been born when the hag had been torn apart and her body incorporated into the fabric of the plane. Regardless of its origin, the fae had quickly laid claim to it. Haludor considered it an eyesore and wanted the party to reclaim it for the devils. The party was willing to try.

The grove was obvious to anyone who walked into the centre of the city, a stark natural green-and-brown in the midst of the gleaming gold. Within the grove lay an expansive, twisting forest. Mircea and Nox quickly found themselves charmed by its beauty.

They encountered several groups of fae as they traveled through the forest, both mischevious and welcoming by turns. As they interacted with the fae, Mircea grew increasingly certain that he could not countenance removing them from the grove.

He told the party as much and this proposal quickly turned into a matter of debate. None of the party had any particular loyalty to Halidor but aside from Mircea, the party felt that aiding her was the best way to get close enough to accomplish the task Glasya had set them.

A nearby group of satyrs broke up their conversation with an invitation to join their revelry. Though the party was influenced to join by the magic in the air, it did forestall the conclusion of the argument, allowing each member of the group time to consider the unexpected new option that lay before them.
