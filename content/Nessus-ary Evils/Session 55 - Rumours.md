# Session 55

In Cania, Marica was keen to utilize the alchemical labs under Gamelat's purview to continue her research on ichor. Nox, though not particularly academically inclined, was intrigued enough by why she might learn about divinity from her studies to accept her invitation to accompany her.

Gamelat was certainly willing to allow Marica the use of an empty bench - even more so when Marica divulged the details of her project. Although she did not make it a requirement, she made the request that any interesting details be shared with her. The Nine Hells held an interest primarily in seirimic ichor, of course, but that did not mean knowledge of godly ichor would not inform their understanding.

As expected, the ichor recovered from Titivilus' vault proved to be a match for that used to create the dagger that had killed the envoy Grief so long ago, though Marica was unable to determine its origin. However, now having a second vial of ichor, she was able to commit to the use of the blood of the Arbiter. She applied an ointment derived from the stuff to her eyes and found almost immediately that all imperfections in her vision vanished and some minor abjurative power was conferred to her from the god Itself.

Marica informed Gamelat of her results, garnering interest and some information about Gamelat's project in return. She was occupied with the task of tuning hellfire to overcome only the defences against fire of seirim, leaving the devils free to use it without danger. Obtaining a live specimen for testing would be of great help to her but current events made that difficult. Marica, knowing that the party would inevitably be travelling to Avernus, offered to attempt to capture a seirim while there.

Before they departed, Gamelat asked Marica and Nox if they had heard the rumours about Lohengrin and the duke consort that had been gaining traction in the last several days. Feigning ignorance, the pair learned that while this latest of Lohengrin's infatuations was hardly out of character for them and many, if not most, devils correctly assumed Faustus' ulterior motive, the archdux would be required to take action to preserve their image.

Meanwhile, at the observatory of the Septaspire, Apollo had already begun scouring the massive directories that held coordinates for all known celestial objects for any reference to Asterism. As he did so, he and Mircea took the opportunity to speak. Apollo shared some of what he had accomplished in his investigation, though he kept many of the pertinent details to himself, while Mircea expounded on his growing theory about the shortcomings of the gods. Apollo was interested but as he didn't have any great attachment to the gods had little to add.

The conversation turned to the Morninglord in particular, with Apollo asking Mircea if he intended to remain in his cursed shape. Asking Coramin's assistance - and by extension his god's - was a known option but Mircea did not trust Its intentions, especially as he suspected that all this, even his burgeoning plan to alter the nature of the gods, was in accordance with Its plans. Apollo accepted this, saying that sometimes one had to roll with the punches.

This prompted Mircea to ask if Apollo had some history in fistfighting, since this was not the first time he'd made such a comparison. Reluctantly, Apollo explained some of how Kai had raised him, though he emphasized that he intended to follow his own path when he was made baron, hewing more closely to what was expected of a noble. Mircea warned him against following expectations, as it was an easy way to lose sight of what made him himself. Apollo dismissed this, saying that he knows who he is.

Once the coordinates had been obtained and the telescope trained on Asterism, Mircea looked through it to see a blazing yellow-white star the likes of which he had never encountered in life. Though not physically proximate to Asterism, the magic of the Septaspire and Karaiel's influence allowed Mircea to speak properly to the angel for the first time. They had not expected Mircea for some time but they were glad to speak to one who shared their views.

Mircea shared his thoughts: at first he had thought it best to simply eliminate the gods but now he was beginning to wonder if there was a way to put things to rights. Karaiel agreed, though they felt it was something of a misnomer to say beings designed flawed were broken. In fact, they had spent much of the last several thousand years seeking a means to the end of influencing the gods; lately they had found it.

Information had come to them of objects known as chalices, which were most easily described as scrap metal from the time when the laws that govern the gods were laid down. They suspected that bringing together all eight of these chalices might allow them to harness that primordial energy to effect some change. Of course, any modification made to the nature of reality itself must be carefully considered. Mircea, shocked to hear about the true nature of the chalices he and his companions had repeatedly encountered, said that he could likely obtain at least one of the eight from its bearer. Karaiel bid him do so and promised to work on the matter as well from their end.

When the connection was severed, Mircea shared what he'd learned with Apollo. Apollo had just come into possession of Maia's chalice and told Mircea as much, though he couldn't give it to him until he had resolved his investigation. Mircea accepted this for the time being.

With their business on the material plane concluded, Apollo returned Mircea to Mephistar and made to travel back to his original destination of Proscenium. However, he was forestalled by Mircea's conversation with Marica and Nox about his plan, which turned into a short argument. Marica especially advocated caution while they still did not have a complete picture of the possible ramifications of such an action.

Before the matter could be properly settled, Hutijin stepped into the room. He had traced back the gossip about Lohengrin and Faustus to its source, namely the party, and he informed them as consequences that both they and Lohengrin were being removed from Cania. No hard feelings, he claimed, but  decisive action was needed to manage the matter effectively.

With the party in tow, Hutijin descended down into the underlying city to retrieve Lohengrin. They knew better than to resist the left hand of the archdux himself and allowed themself to be taken to the Bureau of Transportation alongside their enemies.

The moment they had been returned to Stygia, Lohengrin lunged at Nox. Marica retaliated with a polymorph that turned them into a rat. Apollo took a moment to contact Iz to talk her into retrieving his companions at their request before leaving himself. Using a complex combination of spellwork and good old fashioned manacles, the party was able to subdue Lohengrin in their humanoid form long enough for Marica to lay a geas upon them to prevent them from attacking further. Lohengrin, recognizing when they were beaten, surrendered and agreed to await *Satisfaction* without resistance.
