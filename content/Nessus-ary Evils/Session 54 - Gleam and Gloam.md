# Session 54

The coils of a massive serpent rose up around Apollo as he took in his first glimpse of the plane of Gleam. He and the snake, who gave its name as Catastrophe, stood on an island of sand in a vast sea. Maia Abbas was nowhere to be seen. For lack of any other immediately obvious source of information, Apollo questioned the serpent about the nature of this place. Catastrophe indicated that although Apollo had no memory of it, he had been here many times before. It also revealed that it had encountered Maia on at least one occasion during which it had bitten off his hand and swallowed it - and Dragon's Breath - whole.

After absorbing this information, Apollo was pondered his options. As a mortal in the realm of dreams, one could exert a certain amount of control over his surroundings, and he even moreso due to the spell that had brought him there. Furthermore he was currently within the bounds of Maia's dreams meaning that the man must be present to sustain them and locating him was simply a matter of time, not possibility.

With these facts in mind, Apollo first tried to just transport himself to Maia's position but he was unable to convince his mind to completely shed the laws of the reality that governed him in the waking world. However, he was able to conjure a boat and a compass to lead him across the water. While he sailed across the wide sea, he questioned Catastrophe about the lingering presence of Gleam that he had noticed on himself and Marica. Catastrophe was unsurprised by this, as all those who slept and dreamed retained the influence of the plane. Only mages powerful enough to sense the touch of other planes ever took notice.

Some time later, Apollo reached the shore of another island where a small idea of a cottage had been constructed. Inside, Apollo came face to face with Maia Abbas, or rather the remnant of him that existed in the realm of dreams. He was quite willing to answer Apollo's questions and, most notably, was able to confirm that Agares had killed him and taken Dragon's Breath for a time. He would be willing to provide witness testimony to the same in court.

He also suspected that the two of them shared an earthly soul, though Maia for his part put little stock in the idea of reincarnation making Apollo somehow beholden to him. Still, this was a potentially key piece of evidence in Apollo's case against Agares, as if his soul was indeed the soul of Maia Abbas, Agares had by transitive property taken the sword he rightfully owned from him. In order to confirm Maia's suspicion, he asked the marut to take him to Malbolge to speak with Glasya.

Meanwhile, the rest of the party puzzled over the exact reason that Lohengrin was unwilling to return to Stygia. Even if they preferred to stay in Cania, the party was not certain why they would not leave to perform the ritual and then simply go back to Cania. Marica, as the only member of the group who hadn't irrevocably angered Lohengrin, offered to ask them. While she was gone, Mircea shared what he had learned of the seirim's plans for Avernus and Zariel with Nox. His information certainly shed a different light on Zariel's evident survival of the occupation of Avernus.

On the matter of Zariel, Mircea confided in Nox that he had been wondering of late whether his oath to Zariel truly reflected what he believed. Like the fallen angel, he could no longer countenance the way the gods treated their followers. Nox, keenly interested in light of his ambitions of godhood, asked Mircea what he meant. Mircea outlined what he had read on the nature of divinity and declared his conclusion that there was something fundamentally wrong with the gods. He felt that they were not acting in service to the manifest anchor of Belief and had forgotten that they existed to serve mortal, not the other way around.

Nox protested that this was impossible but Mircea simply claimed that the impossibility of the situation was itself proof that something was deeply out of alignment here. In spite of his usual attitude toward his companions, Nox made what seemed to be a genuine offer to aid Mircea in his path which Mircea was happy to accept.

Elsewhere in Mephistar, Marica came across Lohengrin in the halls and plainly asked why they were unwilling to return to Stygia for even a short time to aid their archdux. Lohengrin snapped that when Levistus was freed from their prison there was little chance that they would be allowed to enjoy the freedom to do as they pleased ever again. Of course, they would return to Stygia to do their duty to their liege one day but it would be on their own terms.

Marica, though more sympathetic than her fellow adventurers, was growing impatient with the sheer selfishness of fiends. She made a bald-faced threat to Lohengrin that if they did not perform the ritual, the party would find someone else to do so. Surely upon being freed by a group of strangers Levistus would gravely punish his first warlock for abandoning him. Lohengrin wavered briefly but they did not consider the party enough of a credible danger to force their hand.

Hoping that she might be able to uncover a potential weakness, Marica used her wild shape to keep tabs on Lohengrin throughout the rest of their day. Animal life was not native to the planes of the Nine Hells but that very fact meant that no one was used to watching for flies on the walls. Thus, Marica was able to observe their interactions with Faustus undisturbed. It rapidly became clear from the way Lohengrin hung on his every word that perhaps deeper feelings than mere friendship with a fellow warlock were at play here.

She shared what she had learned with her companions, who were not entirely certain how best to leverage this information. Launching their own counterseduction was out of the question given Lohengrin's disposition toward the group but Nox suspected they might be able to bring this to Mephistopheles' attention. He dedicated his time to spreading the rumour among the denizens of the fortress, leaning on the party's ties with devils like Ninsunu and Gamelat.

Mircea, emboldened by Nox's support for his cause, took advantage of the need to let their slander slowly reach the ear it was meant for and decided he would begin uncovering the route to Asterism. Marica did some research on his behalf in the library of Cania and found no references to such a plane, a fact that was revealing in itself. Suspecting from its name that it was perhaps a place among the stars of the Material Plane, Mircea contacted Apollo to request his help in gaining access to an observatory.

Apollo knew just the place: the druid Arietis Starshatterer had established a grand observatory at the Septaspire. The marut with him was not supposed to deviate from its instructions of facilitating Apollo's investigation but, in recognition of the party's assistance to it during its repairs, it was willing to do so. After a quick detour to fetch Mircea from Mephistar, the pair were transported to the Dead Continent, where the Septaspire awaited.
