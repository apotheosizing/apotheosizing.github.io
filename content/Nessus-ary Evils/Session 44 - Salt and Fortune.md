# Session 44

After reconvening with Salome on *Satisfaction* the party whiled away the five days travel toward the distant-but-visible Saltkeep. Nox took the opportunity to enchant the glass vial he had purchased at the Mount with his own blood. Curiously, though most of it was the red of oxidized blood, some of the dregs of the blood were the deep black of ichor. Taking it as a sign of his ambitions coming to fruition, Nox spread the good mood to the rest of the crew.

As became more and more obvious the closer they got, the Saltkeep was encrusted in a strange cocoon. Once disembarked, Marica attempted to identify the substance using her expertise in alchemy. It did not perfectly resemble any material of her home plane but it shared a number of features with periodate compounds, including being transductive of lightning and becoming flimsy in contact with water. Nox, however, bypassed the problem entirely by disintegrating a hole through the cocoon. Within was a perfectly preserved and sprawling manor house, complete with flora and vegetation sprinkled across the grounds. It seemed too to have collected not a speck of dust.

The entrance hall was filled with out-of-climate plants, cementing the supposition of absurd wealth for all of the party. Two duplicate portraits depicted three sisters of various ages, the eldest of whom was still far too young to be the head of the family. All other artwork on the walls depicted a wide variety landscapes and still life, lending no clues to the original location of the manor.

A smashing sound to the west drew their attention to a dining room still set for a meal. Even the soup, though lukewarm, remained fresh. Fragments of a single plate were found before the opposing door to the west and soon after a teacup met the same fate. In a moment of competitiveness, Nox began attempting to one-up the destruction, culminating in the firey destruction of one of the dining room tables. The pointless destruction did indicate something to Apollo, who did not see any ethereal creatures in the vicinity - most phantoms could only affect the Material Plane with direct touch but whatever ghost haunted these halls could move anything within them.

A quaint fountain of a merperson was stationed just outside the dining room, seemingly holding nothing but aesthetic interest. The nearby kitchen attempted to ensnare Marica and Nox when they walked inside but using unconventional exits managed to thwart the force keeping them there. Behind the kitchen was a small guest wing, complete with a private meeting room upon which a number of maps of shipping routes and seasonal tidal charts had been strewn. It was becoming increasingly apparent that the immense riches of this house had been gained through trading across the mares between Voäte and Saveyron of Panthalassa.

Another of many gardens was placed to the east of the kitchens. This one was dominated by an unassuming well that was missing a few stones. Marica, being a water genasi and thus quite at home in water, opted to plumb the depths of the well in search of anything of interest. Apollo, with his truesight, caught sight of four ghostly fingers clinging to the edge of the well. As Marica was gone for a longer and longer period of time, the rest of the party grew increasingly nervous. However, there was no suggestion of trouble until Apollo was overcome with the urge to throw himself into the well.

Fortunately for him, Marica had been unsuccessful in locating the bottom of the well even at several hundred feet of depth and had begun to rise to the surface. She was able to intercept Apollo and cast a spell to force him to the top of the water despite his best efforts to resist. His mind was clearly not his own and he began to attack Marica. She quickly cast a restoration spell, affording Apollo a moment of clarity during which he could shake off the foreign influence. The two climbed out of the well and immediately started arguing about Marica’s blasé risk-taking. In his frustation, Apollo blasted the well with a fireball, cracking several stones from the rim.

Nox and Mircea, in an effort to look at anythig else, noticed that a crack had developed in the cocoon. It had certainly not been present when they entered the room. Apollo initially theorized that harming objects under the ghost’s influence might be the cause but he disproved it by setting a cookbook he retrieved from the kitchen aflame to no effect.

Venturing further to the east, the party explored a private bath, a sauna, and a small pool all in close proximity. Having even one of these in a residence would be seen as extravagant and all three was frankly ridiculous. Another compact guest wing could be found here but, aside from Marica feeling a compulsion to rip up the discarded parchments on one of the desks provided to guests, there was little of note.

At this point, most of the party was low on resources. Since there was nothing in particular keeping them in the manor, they departed back through the hole Nox had made in the barrier. Rather than the potential of a rest on *Satisfaction*, the party walked into the middle of ship-to-ship combat between their ship and a much larger and better armed vessel. Apollo threw another fireball at the offending ship, causing a gap in the combat that allowed the party to scramble aboard to aid Salome and her skeleton crew. In the chaos, they noted the name of their attacker: *The Compass Rose*, the personal ship of Captain Lohengrin Torunn. Fortune - good or ill - had brought their quarry right to them.
