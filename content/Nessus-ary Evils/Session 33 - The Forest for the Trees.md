# Session 33

Mina shouted for the guard, meaning that the party had scant minutes to acquire the schematics and arrange an exit strategy. The queen consort was a woman of no particular strength and was easily knocked out by Mircea and the parchment retrieved from her unconscious form. Marica opened it, curious about what device would make Mina so insistent on keeping its construction secret. The schematics detailed a humanoid construct which Marica did not recognize but Apollo knew was Eludecia, whom they had last encountered in Virgil’s library.

On their last mission for Carceri, being in control of the asset had resulted in an immediate extraction via plane shift but it rapidly became evident that no such thing was forthcoming. Apollo took the lead in indentifying a path to the nearest exit - the west gate.

As they weaved through the halls, they were able to avoid the bulk of the castle’s forces. Only one straggler, a knight with a guard drake at her side, crossed their path. Shrike dealt with any incoming threats while the adventurers fought off the duo. Nox slew the drake and the knight, fruitlessly hoping it might be saved, hurried off with her fallen friend, leaving a clear path beyond the castle’s fortifications.

The moment they’d passed the threshold of the structure, the party found themselves back in Carceri. As they climbed the interminable staircase up to the warden’s office, the party discussed the design Apolli had identified. Eludecia was a sentient being able to manipulate time, they recalled, and it was evident that Mina had been concerned by the possibilities of any person with an agenda getting their hands on the ability to alter causality itself.

However, the party realized they had little choice but to hand it over. They could not withstand the wrath of Carceri. So, with troubled hearts, they relinquished the schematics to the warden. It begrudgingly admitted that they had done an effective job and informed them that the marut they were replacing would be in operational condition by its next assignment. They were officially released from their obligation to the plane.

Marica pressed upon their exceptional work to request a meeting with the Arbiter. The warden reluctantly passed along their request and communicated the god’s willingness to speak with them. It escorted the group down the stairs to an underground level. The chamber was dark, illuminated only by a dazzling series of artificial lights and filled with the strange sounds of whirring and exhaust that almost conveyed life. As the lights came up, it became clear that all around them was the Arbiter.

It informed the party that It had been anticipating their arrival and listened to their request for ichor. Surprisingly, It agreed without the need to be further convinced on the condition that they conveyed a message to Glasya, with whom It sounded familiar. The message was simple: “Be sure.” The party agreed and was thus gifted with just enough ichor to cover both Marica’s personal interest and the construction of Caim’s murder weapon.

Having no further business in Carceri, the party formally applied for their release. The warden kindly reminded them that he would see them at the end of their probationary release before sending them back to the shining city of Proscenium.

Using Marica’s lack of knowledge of Lost Hope’s location, the party was able to find it again and speak with Caim. He was impressed that they had been able to obtain the required ichor and magnanimously allowed the party sanctuary in the building for the duration of their time in Malbolge. Before he bid them a good rest, however, he wondered if they would be willing to further assist in his supplanting of Halidor.

Though her death would be useful in removing her from her position, the land on which her eponymous establishment was built represented an important holding. For reasons even Caim couldn’t articulate, the idea of place was exceedingly central to fae and he insisted that it would properly legitimize his position if he had the deed to Halidor’s. There were two notarized copies of the contract of ownership, one kept in Halidor’s personal storage and a record of the same at the Bureau of Property. Both would need to be retrieved and forged with Caim’s name, preferrably before Halidor’s murder.

The party began to devise a plan before remembering they had not slept since leaving for Rorhassa. Therefore, they retired to their quarters to rest before finalizing any preparations to obtain the deeds.
