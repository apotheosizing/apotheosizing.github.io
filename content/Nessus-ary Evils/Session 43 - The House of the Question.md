# Session 43

The dragonrider awaited a response, though the adventurers themselves were not entire sure what they had experienced in Frostfound. They countered by asking what she was doing there, to which she replied that she lived there. She appeared to be familiar with the strange properties of the castle given that she asked what memories they experienced. Her own were the memories of a traveling bard who got on the wrong side of a powerful spellcaster.

They spent a short time speaking with the rider - who eventually introduced herself as Idris Varlineau. Neither wanted to divulge much about themselves and when the conversation petered out, the party excused themselves. On their way out, the dragon (in truth a dracolich, as identified by Apollo) remarked on Apollo’s presence in Stygia. She indicated that his status as wielder of Dragon’s Breath was well-known among her kin and let slip that she knew what had happened to its previous owner. Idris had killed him.

Preferring not to linger on that, the party immediately began sharing the salient details of the memories they experienced in Frostfound. It became clear that Apollo and Marica’s memories were connected and, perhaps, the four sets of memories occurred in a similar time period, if the war was the same event. Apollo attempted to use a spell to learn more about the subject of Marica’s memories but he found himself misspeaking the words of the spell, unable to cast it. He later tried again to the same result, making it clear something was preventing the spell from working on this particular individual.

Upon their return, Salome outlined a number of possible destinations. Scouting ahead revealed that they were within sight of the House of the Question, the home of an oracle, the Mount, where a black market had flourished, and the Saltkeep, which was rumoured to be haunted. The various mysteries surrounding them pushed the party to choose the House as their first place to visit.

On the three-day journey, Nox spent some time cultivating a rapport with Salome. She was impressed by his ability to keep up the skeleton crew’s morale and, since they already seemed to be kindred spirits as former soldiers, she invited him for dinner. The two talked briefly about the situation in Avernus. Nox massively misrepresented his station in the military, impressing Salome further, much to his satisfaction.

The House of the Question was an unremarkable building, resembling any number of temples across the planes. Its sole occupant was the oracle. He was bound to answer a single question brought to him by a supplicant. Of the four members of the group, three of them asked a question of Ariel. Initially, Mircea sought to know how to evade the destinies laid down by the gods. Ariel said that, given his answer would come from the mouth of two deities, he would be better off asking something else. Instead, Mircea asked where he might find the remaining journals of Kara Krasendel and was told that they were in the possession of the angel Karaiel - Krasendel’s true identity - in a place among the stars. Marica asked about the origin of the compass her mother had given her. They told her that the Wanderer’s Compass was taken from the heart of a plane called Asterism. Nox asked what the memory he had missed in Frostfound entailed. Ariel described the memory of a queen’s final moments before deciding to take up the mantle of a god, giving Nox knowledge that the supposed ritual of apotheosis existed and of who last possessed it.

Apollo decided to keep his question in reserve. After the revelations were given, the party asked Ariel about himself. He, being a living being, was entitled to a question of his own, though he had not asked it. They had been present in the House for long enough ages that they could not say how much time had passed. Nevertheless, they did not seem greatly troubled by their circumstance, though they were clearly interested when Mircea declared he would return if he ever found a way to subvert fate.

The party collected some holy water from the font - a rarity to find in the planes of the Nine Hells outside of Nessus - and returned to *Satisfaction*. Salome had not seen any other promising desinations on the horizon, keaving the Mount and the Saltkeep as their only known proximal locations. Not keen to wander blindly in search of other options, the party opted to visit the Mount for some shopping.

Marica, who was assisting in navigation, noticed at this point that their travel estimates were growing steadily longer. It had been two days to Frostfound, three to the House, and would be four to the Mount. She could not say what the cause might be. While plotting out the course, she also took the time to commune with the nature of the plane and noted with some curiosity that she and Apollo were subject to the influence of a place called Gleam. Apollo recognized the name from a book he had found in Proscenium describing a plane of dreams. Neither Nox nor Mircea had any lingering connection to this place.

The party put that potentially troubling fact aside, for they were nearly at the Mount. Salome, for once, disembarked with them, hauling a large chest with her. Though not as extensive as the markets in Abrymoch nor as magical as those in Mephistar, they came across several notable finds that made the trip worth it.
