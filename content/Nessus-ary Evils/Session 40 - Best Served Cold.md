# Session 40

In the middle of her rest, Marica was awoken by the sound of footsteps and whispers in the hall just outside her room. She could not, at first, make out how many individuals were present but with the use of wild shape she was able to slip between the frame and the door to see what was transpiring.

The duke consort was speaking with a creature that Marica was certain was celestial. They spoke of Faustus’ faithful service both to Nessus and to ‘the Magisterium’ and, in recognition of this loyalty, they had come bearing a warning. In no uncertain terms the angel made it clear that were Mephistopheles to ally with Glasya and fail to depose the Liege of the Nine, the fact that the Liege loved him would not cause It to stay Its hand. Faustus deflected and the angel reminded him of his last encounter with an angel, making a further personal threat obvious.

The angel disppeared and the duke consort left the hall, allowing Marica to reach Apollo’s room without further delay. She shared what she had overheard with him and the pair wondered over the identity of the angel for a time. Apollo questioned whether it had any potential bearing on the investigation but there was nothing conclusive that they could figure out.

After they were appropriately rested, they filled in the rest of the party. Likewise, they concluded it had nothing to do with their current task, though it might make striking an alliance on Glasya’s behalf more difficult if Faustus considered the threat worth worrying about.

However, even the possibility of that discussion was predicated on fulfilling the terms of their contract with the duke consort. As such, they decided they would begin the day by visiting the linens room to see if they could dig up any clues related to the first assassination attempt. The two workers were not particularly forthcoming or helpful but neither did they impede the party’s investigation. After some searching, the adventurers managed to locate the sheets in question - immediately obvious by their destroyed state and the ichor staining them - and retrieve a small sample of blood.

Consensus was that the blood likely belonged to Faustus himself but on the off-chance that it wasn’t, they went to speak with him to confirm the matter. He could be found once again in the Archives, where he was deep in research to the point that in irritation at being interrupted, he almost knocked out Nox with eldritch magic.

The duke consort confirmed that he had come to no harm on that first attempt and used a short ritual to identify the movements of the person to whom the blood belonged for the past month. That the spell showed anything at all proved that it belonged to a still-active member of the plot and not either of the two executed co-conspirators. All of this individual’s movements were within the walls of Mephistar and were particularly concentrated in a small side room of little note. Faustus returned the blood to Marica when she expressed an interest in using it for scrying and he dismissed them so that he could return to his books. Nox, with surprising charm, was able to convince Faustus to heal his injuries and provide a small magical boon to him before he departed.

The question become whether it would be wiser to wait a day to allow Marica to scry using the blood as a focus or to take advantage of the element of surprise and go to confront the assassin then and there. After all, any delay might afford the assassin’s agents time to alert them to the party’s plans. With this in mind, the party used the mirror network to reach the unassuming hallway indicated by the map of blood to be the assassin’s lair.

The door was mundanely camoflauged so that anyone who was not expect to find it would not notice it, but as the group knew to look, they were able to open the door with ease. It was not bereft of magical protections, however, as opening the door activated a symbol spells that Marica was only barely able to dispel. Within the chamber was a single desk where a tiefling had clearly just been seated, though they had lept to their feet at the sound of their wards being breached. To Mircea’s shock, this person was familiar to him. Jezebel, one of his companions from his defeat of Strahd, was the one responsible for all of this.

The two had not parted on good terms and the passage of time had not led them to look on him with more generosity. Mircea made an effort to speak with them which they ignored in favour of attacking the party, summoning a hound of shadow to aid them.

The battle was brief but bloody, with Nox sustaining significant injuries before the others were able to subdue Jezebel. Figuring that they might attempt to escape once reawakened, Mircea created a circle of magic to contain them, though Jezebel immediately made a nearly successful escape attempt, only to be stopped by Apollo.

Having little other choice, Jezebel admitted to their crimes. Even years ago in Barovia, they had hated Faustus, but their plan for his death came from a desire both to hurt the archdux and destabilize the political situation of Cania. Hutijin was, according to rumour, not as loyal as he appeared and Jezebel had some inclination of using that to their advantage, but years of planning and waiting had ground down their ambitions to simple murder. They regretted, too, the loss of innocent (or mostly innocent) lives in their plot.

With the exception of Nox, none of the party could reasonably fault Jezebel’s hatred of the eternal infernal despots of the Nine Hells, and they were not keen on the idea of allowing them to be executed. Fortunately, the precise wording of their contract with Faustus had not specified that they needed to do so, only that they solve this problem for him. Glasya, being the self-styled patron of rebellion, would likely be interested in a capable sorcerer like Jezebel, particularly as they worked toward their coup d’état. Jezebel expressed an interest in the idea, particularly as an alternative to their unceremonious death, and Glasya agreed to grant them diplomatic immunity to prevent any retaliation from Cania

The moment the matter was settled, Jezebel made to leave for Malbolge. As they made their final preparations to leave Mephistar, Mircea intercepted them to try to apologize for his behaviour back in Barovia. Jezebel was not entirely convinced by him but they indicated that they would be willing to speak with him properly about it upon his return to Malbolge. All that remained was to report their findings to Faustus and, hopefully, to broker the first of Glasya’s new alliances with Archdux Mephistopheles.
