# Session 58

Prior to reconvening with his allies in Maladomini, Shemyaza made their promised visit to Nox. Without preamble or explanation they transported both Nox and Artemidorus to the plane of Nessus, though Artemy was not phased by this turn of events. Thusly, Nox took it in stride when he was ushered into a small meeting room by the angel and told to take a seat among his fellow First Warlocks.

Attendants of note were a severe-looking woman with whom Nox was not familiar - presumably Beelzebub's First Warlock - and Coryander, who had completed their return to their former position. Lohengrin's absence was briefly noted as Shemyaza began to officiate the meeting but only Nox had any indication of their true fate.

Beginning with Nox, each warlock provided any pertinent updates that they were willing to make their counterparts (and so their archduxes) and the Liege of the Nine aware of. Nox carefully informed the assembled warlocks that while he had no news from Avernus, he and his companions were working to ensure Zariel's safety and the repelling of the seirim from the plane. Beelzebub's warlock, who introduced herself as Livia Valerius, cast doubt on the severity of matters on Avernus, seemingly drawing on a long-held suspicion that Zariel through Vortigern had falsely used the spectre of the seirim to cement her position. Nox rebuffed this and Livia did not press the issue.

Among the various items of news from the planes, Artemidorus and Faustus made formal proclamations of support from their archdux to Glasya's bid for control of the Nine Hells, which had been hanging over the entire meeting as a known but unspoken quantity until Apollodorus confirmed it. This blatant choosing of sides made it apparent to Nox that when he and the party returned from the past, Glasya would be expecting to put their plans into action.

A more minor but still interesting piece of information gleaned from the meeting was from Faustus, who had brought a number of interesting finds from Orias' team at Kintyre, including another of the elusive chalices.

Back to the present matter of time travel, the party winnowed down their options for the precise timepoint of their destination. Nox, recalling the incident with the other Nox in Virgil's library, stressed the importance of ensuring that they did not encounter themselves in the past. However, as the rest pointed out, since they did not remember any such meeting, they must have already chosen a safe time. He proposed immediately after their last visit to Avernus. Marica felt that giving them more leeway than a mere few days to uncover the nature of the seirim's plans and put a stop to them would be wise.

Eventually, they decided to start by traveling to a week before Mircea was pulled from the River Styx by Virgil and making additional trips further into the past only if necessary. Apollo contacted Glasya's other agents to allow them the chance to accompany them. In spite of the short notice, all four quickly joined the party in Maladomini. Virgil wished them luck with their endeavour and set the temporal coordinates into Eludecia before departing himself.

As Eludecia was not capable of moving people through space, the group arrived in the past of Maladomini. After excusing themselves from a brief, awkward encounter with the devil who had rented the rooms in which they were staying during that time, they made their way to the Bureau of Transportation. Avernus had not laid down sanctions against planar travel in this era so the use of Glasya's emblem was sufficient to afford them passage to the plane - though perhaps the flagrant use of the archdux's personal seal prior to her issuing them to the party would come back to trouble them in the present.

Upon their arrival in Avernus, the party stumbled into a conflict-in-progress between two erinyes, an arcanaloth of unclear (or at least purchasable) allegiance, and a small horde of seirim in which they quickly intervened...
