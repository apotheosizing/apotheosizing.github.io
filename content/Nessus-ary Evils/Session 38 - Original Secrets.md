# Session 38

With the assistance of Orias and Percy, the party was able to fend off the worm. The moment the corpse of the creature hit the ice, Apollo, Marica, and Mircea immediately set about dressing down Nox for being so reckless. Nox was typically unrepentant, leading to Marica dumping a handful of water on his head in annoyance. After she stalked off, Marica was able to harvest a useful component from the body of the worm that she theorized could be used in a potion to cure blindness.

Mircea and Nox took up the duty of keeping watch due to their lack of need for sleep. There was nothing in particular that struck them as dangerous, though Mircea saw what he thought were figures far away on the horizon.

Not long into their travels the second day, they arrived at the ruins of Kintyre. In a flyover of the area, Marica saw evidence of an entire settlement once existing here but one large crystalline building remained perfectly intact, though its component spinel had grown wild over the thousands of years it had been left in disrepair. Its doors were not only unlocked but propped open as though to welcome people inside.

The space was dominated by a large atrium centered around a fountain that ran was clear water despite its hypothesized age. A number of small benches were arranged around it and four branching hallways led down to small chambers.

Each chamber was illuminated by strange torches that emitted a form of light that seemed to absorb visible light. These torches were clearly key to some aspect of the chambers and after it was confirmed that they could not be extinguished, Nox took a cue from the flames and plunged to room into darkness. A strange interaction between the darkness and the torches revealed a mural on the back wall of the room. Time had weathered the murals significantly and Orias surmised that they were missing context in their interpretations, but a few seemed to depict scenes of the creation of the Nine Hells.

According to myth, the Ruby Rod was used by the Liege of the Nine to form the planes of Baator from the primordial material of the universe. However, these murals seemed to indicate that the Ruby Rod was created after the eight other archduxes, as they were represented in the mural alongside the Liege of the Nine. Apollo and Marica speculated, with their knowledge of Glasya’s intentions, that the mural might in fact depict the future of the Nine Hells rather than the past, indicating Glasya’s ascension to godhood and eventual possession of the Ruby Rod.

The murals housed in two of the other rooms were either too heavily defaced or too obscure to yield much in the way of information. The final area they checked, to the southeast, had a dais with eight places that could hold some form of artifact. Its mural was covered in hexagonal shapes that seemed to have no connection to the typical numbers associated with the Nine Hells. Those in the party not from Barovia were aware that a group of six traditionally associated gods - known as the Hexune - were often represented by the number six but the existence of many hexagons made the idea that the Hexune were involved unlikely.

When the group returned to the focal chamber, the party came face-to-face with another expedition that had been sent out to Kintyre. Initially, there were some hostilities between the two groups but when their leader, Ariel of Cascaris, told the party that they were working for the notorious Akorace Siannodel, one of the most prominent figures in the revolution in Menzoberranzan that had taken place twenty years prior, it was clear that they were not enemies - or at least not for the time being.

Having no idea how to interact with the dais, Orias concluded that the sketches she had taken of the murals would suffice for the time being. Further research would need to be done before she could make any more headway in exploring Kintyre. Though lengthy, their journey back to Mephistar was without incident. Using the diamond seal she had been given, Orias opened the gates to the citadel for the party, stressing that they should not do anything to jeopardize her reputation while within Mephistar’s walls.

One of the staff escorted the party to the office of Hutijin, a duke of Cania and purported left hand of the archdux. He subjected the party to magical questioning to ensure that they were not a danger to the duke consort and, once he was satisfied that they were benign, provided them directions to the ice garden where the man Mircea had been looking for since his arrival in the Nine Hells could be found.

Among the glittering ice flowers of the gardens of Mephistar, the party met with the duke consort, who was not best pleased by the appearance of troublemakers from his past (or their sons) in the midst of such tumultuous times. Nevertheless, he was willing to hear Mircea out.
