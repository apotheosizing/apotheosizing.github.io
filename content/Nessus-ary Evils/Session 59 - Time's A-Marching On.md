# Session 59

With the aid of the party, the two erinyes succeeded in destroying the invading seirim. They then turned their attention toward the arcanaloth, Simta, who quickly reminded the devils that she had done nothing that violated either the spirit or the letter of her employment contract with the archdux. The erinyes briefly set aside the matter - as Simta was a known quantity - to determine the intentions of the party. When it became clear that Mircea and Nox were more highly placed in Avernus' ranks (at least, they were in their present incarnations), they deferred to the party's judgment about Simta's fate.

At this point in time, Zariel's armies had only recently suffered the losses that forced the retreat to the Castle of Unholy Triumph. If the party wished to speak with the archdux, they would need either to intercept the march or wait until they reached their destination. Given the slow speed of armies across great distances, the party was inclined to attempt to meet it on its way - however, speaking to Virgil to secure their means back to the present was the more pressing task.

The River Styx had been a gruelling journey taken on foot when the party was last in Avernus but to their relief a pair of the mechanized vehicles pioneered for the war effort were stationed nearby. A payment of a soul coin was required to activate them but this was a trivial cost to the party. Having a much swifter means of travel, Polly asked if she and the rest of the Malbolge continent might be better sent to another destination in order to cover more ground. The party debated sending them to Quintestra to seek the aid of Lilith and her god in dealing with Şenkă though they ultimately decided against it.

Likewise, they considered scrying on Şenkă in order to get an idea of what he was up to before dismissing it as too risky. As far as they knew, Titivilus was the only individual in the Nine Hells who was aware of his nature. Ensuring they retained the element of surprise would be key in managing to subvert his plans given the long odds they were facing.

The group split into three for the sake of seating: Apollo, Marica, and Nox in one vehicle and Artemy, Polly, Calanthir, and Jezebel in the other. Mircea opted to summon a mount for himself, a marchosias. Thanks to the greater speed of the vehicles, the party estimated that they would require only four days to reach the river and, so as not to waste any time, they set forth immediately.

During the monotonous drive, Marica asked Nox what his motivations were for his apotheosis. Nox explained that it would do nothing more than make obvious to the world what he already knew to be true: that he was a god. Marica, a little confused, clarified that he, categorically, wasn't a god yet, but Nox dismissed this as mere semantics. Remembering the size of the ego of the person she was talking to, Marica decided it would be simpler to just agree rather than argue any further.

Meanwhile Apollo pointed out to Mircea that now might be a good opportunity to speak to Calanthir about the chalices and convince them to share what they knew with the party. Mircea did so, opening by asking Calanthir straightforwardly who gave them the responsibility of keeping their chalice safe. Calanthir did not take well to this line of questioning, coldly reminding Mircea that they had gone so far as destroying their memories in order to protect that information from those who might seek to misuse it - clearly counting Mircea among that number.

Things rapidly became more hostile as Mircea insisted that the keepers of the chalices were manipulating them to think and act in a manner that would maintain the inequitable status quo from which only the mysterious beings who had made the gods benefitted. Calanthir was not receptive to this to the extent that their choice of means to demonstrate that they knew very well what they were doing and could make their own decisions was attacking Mircea. Only one of their daggers found its mark but this was more than enough to significantly injure Mircea.

Rather than retaliate, he caught Calanthir before they fell from Mircea's mount and reiterated his point: they were being misled so expertly that they didn't even realize how their thoughts were being shaped. Apollo intervened before things could get any worse, separating the two.

Hours later the party decided to stop for the night. Marica, who felt that Mircea had been out of line in antagonizing Calanthir, attempted to ensure they were alright but Calanthir was not receptive to this approach either. Still, Marica extended to them an open offer to speak with her any time before leaving them to equilibrate.

Mircea was not particularly surprised to find Calanthir approaching him when the rest of the group had gone to sleep. Though it was not initially clear whether they had come to make amends or to finish what they had started, Mircea pre-empted them with an apology. This surprised Calanthir, since *they* had been the one who had impulsively stabbed *him*, and they expressed their frustration with the party's continuing kindness to them - a stranger they barely knew who did everything they could to be abrasive.

In the hope that it might help them understand his perspective, Mircea told them the story of his time in Barovia and the Morninglord's machinations. Until the last few days of his long life, he couldn't say for certain that he had made any choice he had not been guided to make. Calanthir took some time to absorb this before saying that they did understand, though they did not go so far as to say that they agreed with him.

They did not, strictly speaking, offer their own apology, but they asked Mircea if he required any healing and when he declined insisted on giving him the dagger with the ambiguous statement that the gesture meant whatever he wanted it to mean.
