# Session 32

Though they had a sky pirate among their number, none of the party was strong enough to effectively move the rowboat. To circumvent the problem, Marica summoned forth a pod of dolphins that towed the boat forward. They traveled southeast around the shoreline and past a nearby cove until the Muros was visible on the horizon.

Apollo called upon the elements to create a cloud of fog to mask the dinghy's approach, allowing them to approach the leeward side of the ship. Presuming that the majority of the crew would be career sailors and not trained fighters and spellcasters, their plan was to board and confront the captain directly.

The party climbed aboard using the rigging and brazenly attacked the skeleton crew who were keeping watch for the night. As they'd predicted, none of the pirates posed much obstacle to the adventurers. Marica kicked open the door to the captain's quarters and ordered her surrender. In reply, Ophelia drew her blade and joined the fray.

While much of the party dealt with the crewmates, Marica and Apollo focused their efforts on Ophelia. As the battle began to wind down, Marica transformed into an octopus and threw Ophelia across the vessel, knocking her out. With the conditions of their task complete, all involved were teleported back to Carceri by some magical mechanism.

The warden gave reluctant praise to the party for their accomplishments and indicated that repairs on the marut were proceeding apace. As agreed, they would only have one further day of service to the plane before their release. The group returned to their quarters to rest until they were called on once more.

In the "morning", a small construct informed them of their next task. In collaboration with Carceri, queen consort Wilhelmina Delmirev of the kingdom of Rorhassa had been deciphering a schematic. The party's task was simple: to retrieve it.

As they would be making contact with an ally of the plane, there was little preparation to be done and the party announced their readiness to travel. Shortly, they found themselves in the halls of the palace in Azash, startling a young servant with their appearance. Apollo, being the son of a Rorhassan baron, was able to justify their presence without drawing much suspicion and quickly established their need to speak with the queen consort.

The boy led them to the steward of the castle, who had the authority to discuss the matter further. This woman, Arne, was reluctant to grant their request, even with Apollo's family name behind it. She explained that Mina had insisted she not be interrupted in her work, citing its sensitive nature. However, the party insisted that it was imperative that they speak that day. Arne relented and said she would discuss the matter with Mina when she brought up her afternoon meal.

In the interim, the party was ushered into a receiving room so that they might await the queen consort's verdict. There, they met Pádraig Mystan, a visiting dignitary representing the interests of the Septaspire to the west.

He was a pleasant person, who tolerated the group's (read: Nox's) various antics with amusement. They did not divulge the nature of their visit but otherwise were willing to answer various questions, including ones regarding their evident relationship to the famed Eolo Mystan. Marica inquired whether he had taken to music like his forebear but Pádraig demured, claiming that his talents lay elsewhere.

Arne returned, bearing good news. Their petition had been approved and Mina was willing to meet with them presently. She escorted them up to Mina's workspace and left them to speak privately. Mina had an overworked look about her, though she treated with the party without wavering. She knew why they had come and asked that they walk away without retrieving the schematics. Her work to decode them had succeeded and she insisted that it was unsafe for *anyone* to come into possession of them.

Perhaps she hoped that the fact that the party were not implacable maruts would lead them to acquiesce, but their hands were tied. Nox argued their case, but Marica noticed from the way she stood that she was shying away from them slightly, as though protecting something in an inner pocket. She indicated as much to Mircea, who immediately commanded Mina to disrobe in order to obtain the schematics. The spell did not take, however, leaving the two parties at a fragile impasse that quickly shattered...
