# Session 63

The retreating stream of the army of Avernus trickled at a slow march, making intercepting the train on dragonback no difficulty. As they landed they were met by the familiar-to-them person of Hellion, one of Tamsin's spouses. He assumed that the party had brought news from Quintestra and, as that was not strictly-speaking false, the party did not disabuse him of this notion. He escorted them to Vortigern who interrogated them more thoroughly.

They related the circumstances of their arrival in this past Avernus and detailed the events since, leaving out only the specifics of Apollo's dealings with the Fivefold Queen. Vortigern was not predisposed to believe such an outlandish account from three strangers and a low-ranking officer, much less allow them to speak directly to the archdux, but they nonetheless asked what it was they wished to speak with her about. Nox told them that while the danger to Avernus had been averted, the catalyst of their involvement in these events in the future from which they had come was the lockdown of the plane. Thus to complete the causal loop Zariel would have to take the same actions.

Vortigern had no opinion on the validity of this view of the mutability (or lack thereof) of the dimension of time but they did find the idea of weakening Avernus further after their recent crushing loss against the seirim unacceptable. It was only Nox's presentation of his sword Supernal which held in itself the proof of Nox's faithful service to the archdux that made them agree to bring the matter of an audience before Zariel.

While they waited, the party confronted the difficulty of their arguing position. They could not prove beyond a doubt that the substance of time would be damaged by allowing events from here on to play out differently without seeing it for themselves and they were uncertain whether archdevils had the omniscience that had let them speak easily with the Fivefold Queen. They merely had to hope that they could be sufficiently persuasive.

Only an hour or so had passed by the time Vortigern came to bring them to Zariel's tent. They gave the party a warning not to make them regret bringing their concerns to the archdux before ushering them inside. Unlike when they had met in their temporary court in Unholy Triumph, Zariel was not seated on their throne in full splendor. She sat at the whetstone and looked the party full in the face as she asked them to speak their piece.

They made their proposal uninterrupted. Zariel took some time to consider what they had told them, letting the sound of their sharpening sword fill the tent. Though she had no love of the politicking of her fellow archduxes, she was hesitant to appear publicly weak during such a turbulent time as was to come. Marica simply said that playing dead could be an effective strategy.

Zariel turned their attention to Nox. She knew him well enough to know in his soul that his first loyalty was not to her, nor even the other archdux whose symbol he traveled under even now, but to himself. They asked, then, why they should trust him. Nox said that his loyalty lay as ever with the winning side; he believed that was hers.

Satisfied, the archdux decided that a guarantee of future safety was more valuable than any other nebulous future that might result from changing history as it would/as it had happened. So that they might keep their actions in line with what the party had experienced, they asked for a personal glimpse at these occurrences via direct access to one of their minds. Unspoken was the clear fact that this was the final trial of their trustworthiness.

Nox offered himself and Zariel stepped inside his soul. A moment later she spoke again to seal her agreement with their plan. As they had aided Avernus itself by destroying the Mountain they extended an offer of a boon to the party. Nox unsurprisingly sought the recognition of his efforts through a promotion so she bestowed upon him the rank of dux. They also indicated that they would not interfere to Malbolge's detriment in Glasya's upcoming coup, though they did not go so far as to promise their support.

Before they departed the party asked the archdux about Harut. It was dangerous, still posing an active threat to the plane, and from the execution of Fomalhaut and the tales of the slaughter she had carried out against her companion angels it was clear she had not hesitated to remove similar threats in the past. Why leave Harut?

Zariel did not give a fulsome answer but they briefly explained that Harut was akin to a link in a chain willingly forged by their hands to bind themself to the service of the Liege of the Nine. The party could conclude for themselves that Harut remained alive because the archdux wished it. With this, she dismissed them from her presence.

The party was undeterred from their plan to visit the Sepulchre Pits though exactly how they would handle Harut remained undecided. As they made plans for travel, Nox found that something of Zariel had lingered in him after they had made contact: he could now summon a pair of wings and his innate magic was greater than before.
