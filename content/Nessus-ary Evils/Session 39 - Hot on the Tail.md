# Session 39

The duke consort invited the party to follow him deeper into the garden, away from potential prying eyes and ears. Mircea explained his plight to Faustus and requested his help in nullifying the contracts that kept his soul bound to the Nine Hells. Although the relocation of Mircea’s soul had been the decree of a god, Faustus claimed he would indeed be able to intercede on Mircea’s behalf. His current circumstances, however, prevented him from doing so.

Faustus confirmed that the attempts on his life had been genuine and, after ascertaining their skills, requested that the party solve the matter in exchange for his assistance. Seeing no reason to refuse, they accepted his terms and signed a quickly-drafted contract that provided them with proof that they were working on the duke consort’s orders in the form of their own glowing signatures around their wrists.

The adventurers asked for any details about the previous assassination plots. Faustus obliged. The first had been rather amateurish, not enough of a threat to raise concerns on its own. Small shards of an ichor blade had been snuck into his sheets. Faustus theorized that this was simply a test of the mastermind’s ability to circumvent Mephistar’s security measures, as no harm was ultimately done.

Its follow-up was more insidious, with some form of distilled ichor slipped into his drink. Apparently, the blame fell immediately upon the members of the staff that had been in proximity to these events: Ia, who had turned down the sheets that morning, and Baasha, the head cook. In a moment of ill-considered anger, Mephistopheles put both devils to death without questioning them beforehand, so the exact extent of their involvement was unclear.

It had been some time since the last attempt but Mephistopheles had continued to enforce strict requirements about movement into and out of the fortress.

The party began their investigation by discovering the primary means of transport throughout Mephistar. Rather than use the halls of the fortress, it seemed that the majority of residents of Mephistar used a network of connected mirrors to travel from destination to destination. The group intercepted a daemogoth named Gamelat and inquired somewhat bluntly about the nature of the network. Gamelat, who was under a lot of stress at the moment, did not react particularly well to this but she did provide an explanation before insisting that they had to return to report to their supervisors about the mess in Igneonics at the moment.

Further discussion revealed that Igneonics was a department of Cania’s vast arcane research efforts focused around the study of a substance known as hellfire. None of the party was familiar with it and requested that Gamelat tell them about it, suggesting that their outsider perspective might help them with their problem. Seeing that their presence was directly authorized by the duke consort, they agreed and took the party to Igneonics. A discussion with Marica did prove potentially illuminating for Gamelat, earning their respect and an offer of help from the daemogoth.

The party returned to the mirror network and were again sidetracked by the presence of “specimen holding” among the destinations within the fortress. To their surprise, specimen holding seemed to hold remains from all manner of creature from across the planes, as well as a number of magical artifacts. Apollo noticed an empty display case that was intended to hold the Wand of Orcus, a powerful item he recognized from his father’s stories of the events on the islands of Elihyel years ago.

Remembering that they were supposed to be investigating, the party opted to visit the kitchens. Given that they were only ever in use at the duke consort’s request, there was only a single devil present, the new head chef Ninsunu. As they had risen to the position to replace Baasha, he had little insight into the events of that day, but he was willing to check the staff placement records in the Archives for them.

The party accompanied Ninsunu to the Archives with the intention of taking advantage of the vast resources held within. As they looked around the library’s shelves for Ninsunu to return, Apollo found something peculiar. A red rose had been pressed into the pages of a book discussing historical revolutionary sentiments around the time of the Ossarian Empire. None of the nearby books seemed to have anything similar in them, making this both strange and inexplicable.

Ninsunu furnished them with a list of those present in the kitchens during the poisoning before excusing himself to return to his attempt at figuring out the merits of soup.

The party decided at this point to seek out Faustus to ask him about the Wand of Orcus, since Apollo and Marica recalled that Kai’s tales mentioned that it had been wielded by a powerful - and sentient - seirim. Given Mircea’s trouble with one of the same and the fate that had befallen Avernus, any insights into these rare seirim would prove valuable.

They found the duke consort in his eponymous wing of the Archives and questioned him on the matter. Faustus explained that, much like prolonged contact with Harut and Mircea had transformed the seirim attached to them, the Wand of Orcus was a sentient artifact that had imbued the seirim that would be known as Orcus with consciousness. Unfortunately, he had only possessed the Wand for a limited time and though he could tell them of its properties, it had been forever destroyed during the events on Elihyel. Innocuously, Nox asked when he had first obtained the Wand, which Faustus answered without much thought.

As they had not rested since their journey from Kintyre, the party retired to their rooms for the night, with the intention to resume their inquiries after they had slept. Before going to bed, Nox contacted Virgil with a request. He wanted Virgil to use Eludecia’s ability to travel through time to return to one of the days that the Wand of Orcus was in the possession of the heroes of Elihyel and take it. Virgil, happy to deepen the party’s debt to him, agreed to do so.
