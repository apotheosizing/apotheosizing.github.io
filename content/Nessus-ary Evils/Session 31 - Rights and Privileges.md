# Session 31

The marut escorted the party to the office of the warden, ascending the central tower with the five adventurers trailing behind. As the staircase was a near interminable climb, the party asked the marut several questions. It did not provide much of interest in the way of responses but it did consent to carrying Nox up to the warden's office.

The office was sparse, containing only a desk behind which the warden stood. It welcomed the party inside and pulled up information that detailed their crimes. Mircea and Nox did what they could to argue for Mircea's case, impressing upon the warden that he could not have known that the marut was below him. Furthermore, Nox was inquired how long the marut would be unable to perform its duties due to repairs - approximately two days - and asserted that he would be willing to cover that term in its place.

The warden reluctantly accepted this reasoning and was willing to allow Mircea to walk free for the time being so long as he provided bail. However, there was no good argument to be made against the charge of escaping from prison. Daa√©, who had not yet left Malbolge, was summoned to dole out the party's funds, allowing them to offer a proper goodbye to their companions before the warden dismissed them. Once the escapees had provided bail funds of their own, the warden allowed them likewise to be released pending trial.

Recognizing their humanoid limits, the warden arranged sleeping quarters for the adventurers for the duration of their service to Carceri and dismissed them. The party was exhausted from their fight with the guards and promptly took their rest until they were awakened by a small construct with the details of their task for the day.

In the loosely allied kingdoms of Panthalassa, there was a seaside town called Pithidy Cour. The town itself was unremarkable but it was a frequent port of call for the notorious pirates Ophelia the Blue and her first mate Guinevere. As the construct told it, Ophelia had struck a deal with Levistus many years ago but when the time came to collect, she had reneged. The party's job, then, was the simple task of retrieving her.

Courtesy of Carceri, they were transported across the planes to the shores of Pithidy Cour, where Mircea had his first encounter with sunlight. His flesh began to burn the moment they appeared and Marica, thinking quickly, turned him into a giant crab to prevent any further harm. This made him slightly more difficult to direct and the residents of the town were quite surprised at such a strange sight strolling through the streets, but the party was able to restore him to his usual shape once they had reached an inn.

Staufen and Calanthir broke off to investigate elsewhere in town while the others approached the barkeep. According to what he had overheard from workers at one of the warehouses, Ophelia's ship would be making landfall in the morning to off-load their bounty. As the adventurers had no means of seafaring themselves, they opted to wait out the rest of the day and enjoy the ameneties of their home plane.

Marica and Apollo headed out to the beach to gather ingredients for potion making. As they walked, Marica confessed her concerns about Lucretia. Her mother had recently completed her ascension as a lich and Marica had noticed that she had seemed off since then, though she could not pinpoint why. Apollo offered her a sympathetic ear but there was little the two could do to address the matter directly.

Nox sent correspondence to his co-conspirators in Cimmer to announce that the pontiff had failed to eliminate him. More boldly, he sent a thinly veiled anonymous letter to the pontiff herself to similar effect. Mircea, as obligated in daylight hours, spent his time reading the memoirs of Kara Krasendel.

As evening fell, Calanthir returned and informed them that they had learned that Ophelia's ship, the Muros, would be secretly arriving that night for reasons unknown. Swiftly, the party followed their information and intercepted a pair of deckhands who had been sent ahead with several crates of particular pearls. Being mere pirates, the party was easily able to intimidate the two into taking them to the Muros on their dinghy, where they intended to parley with the captain.
