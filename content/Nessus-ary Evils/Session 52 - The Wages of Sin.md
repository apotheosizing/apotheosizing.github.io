# Session 52

Battle was joined without further ado. Neither Titivilus nor the party bothered to extend the false pretense that this would end with anything but the annihilation of one side or the other. Although the devil was a formidible opponent - wielding the true names of both Coryander and Vassago to turn them to his use in the conflict - Titivilus was never famed for his prowess as a fighter. The party, on the other hand, had tangled most recently with the scourge of Stygia and honed their skills on countless other opponents besides.

As Apollo struck the killing blow with a magic missile, the hand of Dispater descended. They held back death's claim on Titivilus, demanding an explanation for what had transpired. The party first brought forth their evidence of Titivilus conspiring with the seirim and, if not aiding them, turning a blind eye to their occupation of Avernus. Titivilus insisted that the letters they had found contained no such proof.

Coryander's disappearance, too, was a clear-cut example of Titivilus's lies. The party and then Coryander themself recounted what they had said of the circumstances of their imprisonment but again Titivilus claimed he would never do such a thing. Coryander was merely an imposter or trick of the party's.

Finally, Titivilus' assassination of Grief, hinted at by the missive from Glasya they had been carrying that had mysteriously found its way into Titivilus' possession, showed that he was working directly to undermine his archdux. Titivilus stated that this was circumstantial evidence at best, as the letter's providence could not be confirmed.

Any judge might agree that the wide variety of evidence against Titivilus was staggering but Dispater refused to accept any of it for truth. Titivilus was, he said, incapable of lying to him. This initially puzzled the party, as they had just seen Titivilus outright lie about the content of the letters Dispater himself had read. No magical binding that any of the party could detect forced Titivilus to be truthful. It was then that the party realized just how deeply Titivilus had placed himself in the archdux's regard.

It seemed that there was nothing the party could say to Dispater to convince them of Titivilus' true nature. But, just as they began to consider fleeing the plane and considering Dis a lost cause, they struck upon two avenues they had not yet considered. The words of Vassago, a direct servant of Dispater through his arrangement with Titivilus, might be trusted by the archdux. The state of the city and its people, likewise under his absolute control, if viewed through the archdux's own eyes rather than the reports he must have been getting from Titivilus was testament to Titivilus' deeds.

Using his true name, the party compelled Vassago to confirm what they had told Dispater. He did so, in fact warming to the task when he realized that if this worked he might be finally freed of Titivilus' control. Marica then directed the archdux to look beyond the confines of their tower, where Titivilus had held sway for too long.

When he broke the silence, Dispater pronounced Titivilus' guilt. The devil immediately tried to talk himself out of his predicament but Dispater would not allow him the chance to deceive him again. With nothing more than a thought, he destroyed Titivilus forevermore. The earring that Lohengrin had given to the party glowed brightly with the force of Titivilus' broken ambition. To repay the party for restoring him to true control of their plane, Dispater told them that they might count on his aid for Glasya's cause.

After Dispater left them the party turned to the other prisoners of the Iron Tower. Vassago who had nowhere else to go immediately latched onto Nox, who was the member of the party most willing to abuse his emotional vulnerability. Ortephon, meanwhile, disappeared before Apollo could question them in earnest.

Since they were all out of danger, Marica woke Tamsyn, who was not particularly bothered by her imprisonment. Rather, she immediately asked the party whether they had delivered her message to her spouses. The party realized that Tamsyn had not learned about the fate of Avernus and did their best to gently break the news to her. She refused to entertain the idea that Ngozi and Hellion had died, going so far as to insist that she go with the party to Avernus when they eventually travelled there. The party wasn't keen on letting her walk into danger and had other matters to take care of before they could consider attempting to free Avernus but they placated her by agreeing to her terms.

Exhausted from their lengthy day, the party made to return to Tamsyn's apartments to rest. However, before they could leave the tower, a familiar construct appeared before Apollo. The marut whose duties in Carceri the party had taken over while it was prepared informed Apollo that the date for his trial against Agares had been moved up and it had been sent as a courtesy by the warden of Carceri to aid him in acquiring evidence toward the conviction. Apollo bid farewell to his allies for a time, making them promise not to do anything stupid while he was gone.

As the first devils to hear of the lifting of the curfew began to venture out onto the streets, the party stumbled into bed in their apartments, having triumphed over one of their most dangerous adversaries at last.
