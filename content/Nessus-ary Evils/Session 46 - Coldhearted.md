# Session 46

Back on *Satisfaction* Nox was visited by Virgil. He had accomplished the task Nox had given to him during the group’s stay in Cania: obtaining the Wand of Orcus. He indicated that the sanctity of the timeline was unlikely to be compromised no matter how long the party held on to it, as he would be returning it to the exact moment that he had taken it from. Then, he simply vanished, leaving Nox in possession of one of the most powerful artifacts in the history of the universe.

Although he was not attuned to the wand, contact with it was enough to allow communication with it. Nox introduced himself to the wand (which likewise introduced itself as Orcus) and explained that he had sought it out in the hope that it might be able to advise on the matter of Senka. The wand, eager to be perceived as helpful, expounded somewhat on the nature of seirim. It compared seirim to a liquid - having no innate shape but rather acquiring the shape of its container. In Senka’s case, Mircea was that container and in Orcus’, it was the wand.

Nox was surprised to hear it confirm the theory that the wand was the source of Orcus’ intelligence and consciousness. The wand further said that the easiest way to deal with Senka would be to force him into a situation that required him to conform to a new “container”. It volunteered itself for the task, telling Nox that all he had to do was put the wand in Senka’s hands.

Nox was not immune to the wand’s flattery in general but he was not so easily tricked as to agree to that outright. Still, the wand seemed keen to remain in his possession and the use of such a powerful wand would be helpful to him specifically and the group generally.

At about this point, Nox went to speak to Mircea on the matter. Mircea rejected the whole thing outright due to the wand’s seirimic nature. He was certain that bringing it deeper into the Nine Hells was tantamount to bringing a spy behind enemy lines. Even though Nox was inclined to agree with Mircea, he huffed off in annoyance that Mircea didn’t seem to appreciate that he had done this to help him.

Sensing Nox’s opinion wavering, the wand increased its appeals to his ego and claimed to be able to provide him with the location of the ritual of apotheosis that he was searching for. Mircea, meanwhile, went to find Apollo and Marica in the hope that one or both of them might be able to talk Nox into returning the wand. He only had time to wake Apollo and the two went to talk to Nox together.

Apollo mostly reiterated Mircea’s arguments in a calmer tone, though he also reminded Nox that the wand was notorious for disappearing if it was not tied down by attunement. Attuning to the wand was in itself dangerous because of its hatred for all life and, besides, it would make its wielder rot over time.

He was clearly not happy about it, but Nox eventually relented and allowed Apollo to call for Virgil to return and pick up the wand. The lich was somewhat surprised by how quickly Nox had finished with it and he promised to return it “sooner or later” to its proper place in time. As far as the party could tell, there was no catastrophic change to space-time after he left, so they assumed that there was nothing to worry about.

After a rest, the party boarded *Compass Rose* again to hear Lohengrin’s decision. They enthusiastically accepted the party’s offer to mediate a formal negotiation with Cania. Iz was furious about this turn of events but she evidently did not want to make a scene in front of Lohengrin. When she was placed in charge of the ship for the duration of Lohengrin’s absence, she agreed with only a grumble of complaint.

The only obstacle that remained was reaching the planar portal that they had used to reach Stygia. With the plane’s rapid dissolution, it would be at least a week to return to the dock and no one wanted to take that long if they could avoid it. Apollo and Marica were able to transport them between planes but they needed an appropriate tuning fork for the task. Lohengrin suggested that they might have obtained some tuning forks in their plunder of other ships that traveled the wastes and Mircea was able to locate a chest that contained a selection of tuning forks.

Thanks to Apollo’s magical/musical specialty, he knew that, theoretically, each fork would emit a sound that resonated with the fabric of the plane it was attuned to. Unfortunately, he had not heard the frequency of Cania while they were there and wouldn’t be able to match it, but not all hope was lost. Random trial-and-error of the various tuning forks got them to Cania without too much difficulty.

Mephistar graciously received the party once again and the duke consort invited the group to speak with him under the wards in the garden. Lohengrin, who seemed to have suddenly become extremely, uncharacteristically nervous over the course of the walk to the gazebo, outlined the situation to Faustus. He took a moment to deliberate before suggesting a possible solution.

One of the most widely-accepted theories about the manifestation of great entities and planes posited that two manifest anchors were required to form something that would seem to be brought into being *ex nihilo* from the fabric of existence. The first manifest anchor was law. This was the fundamental basis of the creation: an idea like 'mercy' or 'knowledge' or, in Stygia’s case, 'longing'. These were concepts that, as far as anyone could tell, have always existed in reality (though naturally academics hotly debate the feasibility of that). The second manifest anchor was faith (so termed because the theory originated among religious scholars) - belief, in other words, in what the chosen law anchor represents or should be. Sufficient collective agreement causes a new god or plane or *et cetera* to come into existence.

Presumably, the plane of Stygia came to be in a similar way. From what Lohengrin had described, its law anchor remained intact but its faith anchor had stalled, likely as a result of Levistus’ long imprisonment. Faustus suggested that some appropriate sacrifice might grease the wheels and allow the natural process of creation to repair Stygia. Lohengrin offered to take the party to the Chapel of Half Light to offer their regrets to Levistus but they had another idea in mind. Thwarting the great ambitions of Titivilus, who sought to claim authority over Dis right under the nose of its archdux, would be a far more effective sacrifice than anything the party could offer.

Despite being fellow first warlocks of an archdux, neither Lohengrin nor Faustus had any objection to this plan. Citing a need to take some time to develop a plan and Lohengrin’s interest in seeing the sights in Cania, the party asked Faustus for permission to stay in Mephistar. He agreed and indicated that the party’s previous rooms would be ready for them when they returned to the fortress.

Before they headed off, Nox tried to ask some leading questions about Faustus’ time with the Wand of Orcus to assess if anything had changed due to his meddling, but since those events would have been what had happened all along in Faustus’s experience, he had little to say on the matter.
