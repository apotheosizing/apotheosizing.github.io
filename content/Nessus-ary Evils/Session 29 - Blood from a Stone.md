# Session 29
With Mircea's obstinate refusal to force the fae from the grove, the party decided their best course of action was to return to Halidor's to consider their other options. Escaping the grove was no mean feat but eventually they reached the familiar streets of Proscenium.

As they made their way to Halidor's, Mircea proposed that since their objective in Malbolge was to sabotage Halidor, they might be better served by allying themselves with the fae. The rest of the party was willing to entertain the idea, though they wanted to consult with Calanthir first.

They had been surveying the city on their own and had learned some surface-level information about the ongoing conflict. They had no real objections to switching sides to openly work against Halidor but they cautioned the party that Caim - the leader of the fae - was in a weaker position than Halidor.

Daaé chose to remain at Halidor's to smooth over any ruffled feathers caused by the party's lack of success so far while the rest of the party traveled back to the grove to see if they could learn of Caim's location.

Among the trees, they found a trio of faeries. The first, a boggle, was willing to speak with them only after they had been given words that had never been spoken. After much deliberation, Mircea wrote down a phrase on a scrap of parchment and gave it to the boggle. Satisfied, they said that the party would be better off asking their friend. Said friend was a blink dog who sought a flower never bloomed.

Mircea went on quite an arduous journey to retrieve a seed elsewhere in the grove but by the time he had returned, Apollo had finished fabricating a flower to give to the blink dog. Again, the fae told the adventurers that their friend would know where Caim was. The final fae present was a pixie who asked for a piece of the moon.

Since they had flora on their minds, the party searched for any moonflowers in the vicinity. Apollo was able to spot one and presented a petal to the pixie. At last, they were told that Caim could be found at a place called Fool's Hope somewhere in Proscenium.

The party left for the city proper, sending several hours wandering the streets until it occurred to Mircea that the only way to find Fool's Hope might be to give up on finding it altogether, making finding it something that only a fool could hope to do.

This logic won through and the party was granted an audience with Caim. They were surprised that the party was interested in assisting them but they did not heavily question their motives for doing so, as competent help was in short supply.

Caim's plan to deal with Halidor was an ambitious one. They were attempting to procure ichor to use in an assassination attempt. Rather than purchasing ichor on the black market, which would be easily traceable by Halidor and likely alert her to their intentions, they were seeking a way to obtain it from Carceri. Stories told that Carceri had once been part of the plane of Mechanus until it had been gifted to the Lord of the Nine. Supposedly, the Adjudicator remained in residence in Carceri - a god from whom they could take ichor.

Unfortunately, their best plan to enter the prison plane was to commit a sufficiently serious crime. The party was confident they would be able to walk into Carceri without issue due to the emblems they had been given by Glasya. Through circuitous means, Nox communicated their plan to Daaé, who wished them the best of luck with it. They had received a sign from their patron bidding them to go elsewhere in the Nine Hells and would not be accompanying them. Calanthir, however, consented to join them.

Their visit to the Bureau of Transportation was somewhat complicated. The imp they dealt with was reluctant to believe that their emblems were legitimate and, growing impatient, Mircea ended up using a dominate monster spell to bypass the whole situation. However, mind control - or at least, blatant mind control of a governmental agent - was a felony offence and the transportation authority nearly caught the party before they could jump through the teleportation circle to Carceri.

They arrived in a small prison cell, which was to be expected given that the only reason one would visit Carceri was to visit a prisoner. This cell was occupied by a spined devil named Staufen who claimed to know Mircea on account of being Faustus' familiar. He had been imprisoned for impersonation, as whatever authority had detained him was skeptical of his claims of working on the duke consort's orders.

The conversation turned to a means of escape, which Apollo neatly resolved by blowing up the wall of the cell with a fireball. The party emerged into a seemingly endlessly tall tower ringed with jail cells and bumped right into another person in the midst of an escape attempt - Marica.
