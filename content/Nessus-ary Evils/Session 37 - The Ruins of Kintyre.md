# Session 37

The party questioned Glasya on the matter of the loyalties of her fellow archduxes. Levistus and Mephistopheles, the archduxes of the frozen planes of the Nine Hells, were potentially sympathetic to the cause, while Beelzebub and Mammon were not. Dispater and Zariel were wildcards, as one saw every other archdux as a potential threat and the other refused to involve themself in the politics of the planes. Fierna’s assistance had been secured by Glasya herself.

After some discussion, the adventurers opted to travel to Cania due to Mircea’s long-standing desire to meet with John Faustus. Glasya approved, opining that Mephistopheles would be easiest to convince of the archduxes as he had been charged by the Liege of the Nine Itself to act in their best interest.

By use of the golden seals provided by Glasya, the party was able to cross the planar border to Cania with ease. Unlike the other layers of the Nine Hells, Cania’s temperatures were well below those which mortal beings could withstand. Before any other matter, the group sought to purchase clothing to combat the cold. A shop established near the Bureau of Transportation, clearly placed to capitalize on this very situation, sold them a plethora of enchanted rings to protect them, indicating a very different magical ecosystem than the other planes.

Magical items and spell scrolls were astonishingly rare in the Nine Hells all because of monopolies, regulations, and tariffs instated by Mephistopheles. Mephistar, then, was the best and occasionally only place to reliably find arcane materials. Apollo and Marica were immediately dedicated the greater part of their first day on the plane to purchasing alchemical ingredients and spells.

As they grew fatigued, the party found themselves in a traveler’s bar known as The Bloody Pick. While purchasing drinks, Marica spotted a pair of familiar faces: Orias and Percy. The two devils were embroiled in an argument that the party interceded in. Orias explained that she had received special dispensation to explore the ruins of Kintyre that lay on the wastes of Cania - a notable feature in light of the eternal reign of the archdux. Percy wanted to dissuade her from making the journey until she realized that she could press-gang them into providing protection upon hearing their reason for coming to Cania.

According to Percy, the fortress of Mephistar had barred all visits in recent times, claiming that several assassination attempts had been made against the duke consort. However, as a practicing arcanist in Mephistopheles’ direct employ, Orias had been given a diamond seal to facilitate entry to the fortress in recognition of the necessity of fieldwork to accomplish her current goal. She would be willing to grant them entrance in exchange for their assistance.

Having no other firm leads, the party agreed and set out with Orias and Percy after a long-awaited rest. Strange occurrences swept over the travelers almost immediately, with Apollo and Marica finding frozen tears on their cheeks that had to be pried from their skin and a pervasive sense that they were not the only creatures to be found in the wilderness.

These oddities aside, the monotony of the journey led to Apollo giving Mircea the scrolls of sending he had purchased and urging him to contact Faustus. Mircea did so, indicating his presence on the plane to his old companion and requesting an audience. Faustus was not especially cooperative, indicating that he did not entirely believe that Mircea was the one contacting him.

More unnerving was the fact that Mircea received two silent sendings from an unknown individual at the exact interval that his own sendings had taken. Confused but unable to do much more than respond, Mircea told the stranger to contact him in a dream if there was something they wished to speak with him about.

Once exhaustion began to set in, the party stopped to sleep, setting up a small camp. While they laboured, Nox noted a tremor in the ground that he mimicked with magic, drawing the attention of a great worm beneath the ice that shattered the permafrost around them as it rose to strike...
