# Session 50

With a day to kill, Marica turned her energies to the problem of how they would separate Vassago from Titivilus. Astaroth offered to keep Titivilus himself occupied but convincing Vassago to leave his side would not be possible for his most powerful known enemy. She thought that a small, exclusive bar might be of some interest and asked Andrealphas if devils had any intoxicants. They reluctantly explained the existence of what was colloquially called "drop" - essentially a distillation of ichor. It was an illegal substance but its use was generally overlooked by any actual officer of the law.

Calling on Nox's knowledge of the black market, Marica was able to acquire a number of bottles that variously claimed to be made from the blood of gods of the Material Plane and even a few archduxes and the Liege of the Nine Itself. She amusedly earmarked one of the bottles of "Morninglord ichor" for Mircea before returning to prepare for the party.

Back at the manor, as Apollo was finishing up his copy of the wish spell, it occured to him that - for the moment - Mircea was able to cast it. He suggested that Mircea use it to do something about the matter of Şenkă before he lost that ability. Mircea considered the matter but did not act on it yet.

As the hour of the party approached, a number of highly distinguished guests arrived. All the members of the Court of Dis slowly filtered into the manor, with a handful of other devils of prestige following after them. Notably, the once-ascendant Lady Fairfax was not among them. Astaroth quickly intercepted Titivilus and brought him upstairs for a private discussion.

Mircea attempted to draw Vassago away using his disguise as Mordenkainen but he did not appear to recognize the great wizard. Nox eventually succeeded in getting him to part with Titivilus (after ensuring his surrounds were secure) by insisting that he had painted a masterpiece that Vassago would be a fool to pass up viewing. Fortunately for him, Vassago had a soft spot for art and was willing to take a quick look at it.

Once he had been brought to the designated location, Mircea activated his contingency spell to lay down a zone of truth. He then attempted to dominate Vassago to ensure his compliance. Startlingly, the spell successfully affected Vassago, leaving him at the party's mercy.

Taking full advantage of this rare opportunity, the party interrogated Vassago on a wide variety of subjects. Each of them received the knowledge of his true name, freely-given on technicality of the charm effect of the spell. More relevant to their current goals, they were told the passphrase that would bypass Titivilus' many spell and wards over the upper eschelons of the Iron Tower.

Furthermore, they learned that Titivilus claimed to possess a page from the Books of Keeping - the legendary locus of the names of the yugoloths. It was with its resultant knowledge of Vassago's true name and a contract between them that he ensured Vassago's loyalty. Although the fact that no one had ever been able to confirm the existence of the Books of Keeping made them skeptical of this claim, it was nevertheless evident that he had acquired Vassago's name through some means.

Lastly, they learned that Tamsyn remained alive in the hospitality of the cells of the Iron Tower. Titivilus had orderered her capture as a means of securing leverage over the party but their absence from the plane had led his interest in her to fall by the wayside. As far as Vassagp knew, she hadn't been visited for many weeks now.

By the time they had exhausted all avenues of questioning, about an hour of time had passed. The grip of Mircea's spell was beginning to slip. Before sending Vassago on his way, he used modify memory to erase all recollection of the preceding conversation and replace it with Tangie waylaying him.

With their plan executed without a hitch, ample time for socializing remained before the party began to wind down. Nox eschewed his usual schmoozing since none of it would be attributed to him while in disguise but Apollo and Marica spent some time chatting with the guests. Marica met a mysterious fae named Morgan who had a pleasant if unnerving conversation with her about mirrors and allowed Marica to pet her dog Morty.

Later, Apollo joined her in the library where he was subjected to a one-sided rant about the Spaceweaver Chronicles from a visiting merregon. Finally the two of them met with Viscount Orobas and Count Vual in the adjoining garden. Orobas and Marica immediately hit it off and Vual expressed his apologies to Apollo about the trouble Agares had given him regarding his possession of Dragon's Breath.

Meanwhile, Nox recognized the man he had chanced upon a few nights earlier as Earl Curson. He was in the company of Margrave Raum, who expressed her delight with Nox's improvised piano performance. The two's spirits seemed subdued for such an occasion though not quite troubled.

Not long after, Andrealphas ushered the last of the guests out of the manor, leaving the party the privacy to discuss what they had learned. With Tivivilus' passphrase, they would be able to access his quarters in the Iron Tower but reaching Dispater themself would be a different matter entirely. Astaroth suggested that a means of reaching Dispater's domain without alerting Titivilus may be found when they investigated his quarters. Of course, Dispater himself would know of their presence the moment they arrived...
