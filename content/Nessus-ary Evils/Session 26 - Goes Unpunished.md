# Session 26
Apollo and Nox were the first to arrive at the party's apartments in Dis; they were stopped short of entering by the sight of the door having been ripped off its hinges. With an increasing sense of foreboding, they explored the common area of the building. It was obvious that some kind of conflict had occurred and Tamsyn was nowhere to be found.

The pair hurried upstairs to the second floor, where their rooms were. Each of the doors were open, though nothing appeared to have been taken. They found Shrike dead in their room, with an unexpected person watching over the corpse. It appeared to be his father to Apollo and Zariel to Nox. It snapped closed Its pocketwatch before addressing the two of them, saying that It had expected them earlier.

The Lord of the Nine was here to meet the group that had become fast friends with Glasya. It assured them that It had nothing to do with Shrike's death. It had only wanted to remind the adventurers that no matter how secure Glasya was in their schemes, the Lord of the Nine knew each and every one.

With Its message delivered, the god disappeared, though not before taking amused notice of Apollo's possession of Dragon's Breath. Once they were alone, Nox and Apollo began to search the scene of the crime for any potential clues.

They concluded that they had been killed fighting off an attacker, given the defensive wounds on their body. Their killer had taken their contact poison vials but curiously left the chalice.

Apollo contacted Daaé to inform them of what had transpired, causing them and Mircea to hurry back to rendezvous with them. Being short on time, the party put Shrike in the bag of holding, hoping that they might be able to purchase a scroll of resurrection in Minauros. They were loath to risk using conventional means of travel due to their wanted status, instead contacting Virgil.

The lich offered to perform the resurrection ritual on Shrike and the party agreed. Daaé attempted to assist him in grounding Shrike's soul, but the ritual ultimately failed because the true name of their soul was not Shrike. Daaé was able to divine from the memories of the chalice that they had been killed by an orthon, presumably sent by Titivilus.

Daaé proposed that they ask the Raven Queen to retrieve the memory of Shrike's true name and the party agreed, but given their presence in Minauros they took a day to restock their supplies.

During this time, Mircea began to research divine matters. He found a copy of the diary of an angel recovered from the ruins of Annar Vult at the plane's library and read much of it, though borrowing it from the library was not possible.

Nox, meanwhile, was finally successful in attuning to the chalice. The process caused significant psychic strain and showed Nox a srrange vision of the stars but even so, the chalice would not reveal its secrets to him.

The following day, they traveled to the Fortress of Memories. Daaé sought out Nymil, who was delighted to see his spouse and invited the party to rest at his home for the night. Daaé was able to obtain an audience with the Raven Queen with relative speed and they presented their case before Her. The Raven Queen denied their request, saying that it was unwise to involve themself in Shrike's affairs.

However, Apollo's heartfelt appeal to Her was unexpectedly effective and She gave the adventurers Shrike's true name - Calanthir. She cautioned them that reviving this person would not halt the events that their death had set in motion and that restoring them to life went against Calanthir's wishes.

As the party took their leave, the Raven Queen told Daaé to watch for Her sign, as She yet had work for them in the Nine Hells.
