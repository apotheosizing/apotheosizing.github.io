# Session 34

Upon their awakening, the party returned to the ground floor of Fool’s Hope. Caim had worked through the night, calling on his information network to establish a baseline of knowledge about Halidor’s land ownership contract. Security measures around her personal copy were difficult to determine but it was standardized across the Bureau of Property. Ensignees set three questions which would need to be correctly answered to access the contract.

Apollo reminded Caim that the party had no means of disguising themselves, particularly against the truesight possessed by some devils. Caim waved away his concerns and confidently stated that he would take care of it. The content of the three questions, to the best of his spies’ knowledge, were her first loss, the true name of someone close to her, and the nature of her greatest investment.

The group considered the best course of action to take over the morning’s meal. Divining the nature of Halidor’s protections would be complicated, as they had failed to banish the fae from the grove as she had asked. Marica, however, was unknown not only to Halidor specifically but the Nine Hells as a whole and thus would have a certain amount of anonymity. She resolved to begin the process of insinuating herself into the regular crowd at the bar that afternoon.

The remainder of the party asked Caim where the city’s most accomplished rumour mills could be found. He pointed them toward the bars in the theatre district as a first point of contact.

Although the adventurers had arrived in Proscenium a week prior, they had seen very little of the city itself. Now having a basis for comparison, it was evident that the golden glow of the outlying building was a mere veneer in comparison to the heart of the city. Apollo, Nox, and Mircea selected the Last Stand as the establishment they would investigate first.

As soon as they stepped inside, their attention was drawn to a raucous gaggle of devils who had gathered around a familiar pair of faces: Percy and Orias, fellow participants in the card tournament in Phlegethos. Percy was in the midst of regaling the patrons with a tall tale of travel through the Outer Darkness but she was quite willing to put the story on hold to catch up with the group. She put a round of drinks on her tab and squared up for a game of pool with Apollo and Nox.

The trio (both Mircea and Orias were disinterested in being social) spoke about recent events until Nox manoeuvered the conversation to Halidor. Percy was familiar with her, having served in the same squad during their draft days, though they had not been personally close. This knowledge led Nox to ask her the least personal of the questions, the matter of Halidor’s investments. Percy explained that Halidor was engaged in a conflict on two fronts. One was the land struggle with the fae and the other was waged against Glasya for control of the city’s foremost industry: theatre. Both Glasya and Halidor had made monetary contributions to a number of theatres, though Percy could not say which ones.

It was not a complete answer but it did indicate a fruitful path of inquiry. The adventurers bowed out of the pool game and bid farewell to Percy. She encouraged them to return later if they wished, saying that she would be in Proscenium for some time on account of work Orias was doing in the city.

The closest and most ostentatious theatre in the vicinity of the Last Stand was the Rakehell. Its eyecatching exterior had drawn not only the party’s attention but that of Judy and Punch, who had finalized their satire enough to attempt to pitch it to production houses. Seizing upon an opportunity to investigate the playhouse, the group indicated a willingness to assist the imps in negotiating with the artistic director.

He was not particularly impressed by the last minute application, especially as the backstage crew was already working tirelessly on their headlining production. However, after some convincing, he was willing to allow it to be added to the rehersal schedule if they provided their own costumes and props.

Judy and Punch were not familiar with the usual partnerships between theatres and craftspeople in Proscenium, but the party was able to determine that a semster named Ars was a common choice of outsourced costumes for a smaller theatre in the area. As such, they prevailed upon him for an order. Its quick turn around incurred a large inconvenience fee which the adventurers were able to pay with their winnings from Phlegethos.

There was little else to do but wait and so the party reconvened at Fool’s Hope where they whiled away the time until they required sleep, enjoying the time to themselves.
