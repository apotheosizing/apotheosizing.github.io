# Session 48

Upon their arrival in Dis, the party was subject to the usual array of security checks that they would ordinarily bypass in their true forms. The interview itself was unremarkable but presented an opportunity for the party to inquire as to the state of things in the city.

It was obvious that Titivilus had implemented more and more draconian measures of control over the Iron City. Most troublesome among these for the party were the curfew (as they lacked whatever innate sense allowed devils to estimate the time without a sun or the moons as a guide) and the ban against gatherings of more than eight people. Nevertheless, they were determined to see their purpose through.

Thanks to their previous visit to the plane, the adventurers were able to make their way to Princeps Astaroth’s manor home without risking an interaction with any of the very few devils still out-and-about on the streets of the city. Any who were able to wander around out of doors likely had a reasonable belief in Titivilus’ favour, after all.

Mircea initially sought to gain access to the manor in the person of Mordenkainen and, upon being rebuffed by a member of household staff, simply used magic to open the door and let himself and his companions inside. Sufficiently persuaded, the butler timidly brought the group to the princeps.

Once they were alone with Astaroth and Andrealphas, the party admitted to their true identities and asked the princeps for their help in eliminating Titivilus. Astaroth’s long-held rivalry with him made the destruction of his ambitions a clear case of mutual benefit, in the party’s estimation. Astaroth was inclined to agree, though she admitted that she had not intended to make her move against him so soon.

They asked if the party had yet devised a plan to deal with him. Returning his soul to the rivers of Avernus was the most straightforward of the available options, with the downside that it would only forestall his ambitions; even if it took thousands of years, Titivilus might again claw his way to great power in the Nine Hells. Astaroth opined that their greatest obstacle was Dispater’s deep regard for Titivilus. Not only would the Liege of Dis not permit their First Warlock to come to deadly harm within the borders of their own plane, they were the only being truly capable of crushing Titivilus’ ambitions forever.

Nox asked if any attempts to sabotage Titivilus’ image in the archdux’s eyes had been made and Astaroth reluctantly admitted that Titivilus seemed to be untouchable in the eyes of Dispater. His slow effective-takeover of the plane could not have been accomplished if he had not had the notoriously paranoia Dispater’s unshakeable trust. Even so, the party was an unpredictable outside element and Astaroth was certain they would be able to tip the scales in their favour.

She shared the information that access to the highest echelons of the Iron Tower where Dispater dwelt was carefully controlled by Titivilus. Only Titivilus himself and his personal bodyguard Vassago were confirmed to know the passphrases that would bypass the numerous magical protections over the tower. Being one of the few devils in Dis who could afford to flaunt the law, she offered to arrange a small party consisting of influential guests - including Titivilus - to afford the party a window of opportunity to extract the passwords. Vassago was likely an easier target, though neither would be easily convinced into giving up such closely guarded information.

With two such monumental tasks before them, Astaroth invited the party to stay in her home for the time being, as returning to their apartments was out of the question. The party had little choice but to avail themselves of their hospitality and considered the difficult problem of Titivilus all the way to their private rooms.
