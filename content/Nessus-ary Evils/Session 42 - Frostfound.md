# Session 42

The Morninglord had come to offer Its congratulations to Mircea for his efforts to change for the better. Although it had engineered the situation at large, the details of events and Mircea’s response to them was in the hands of fate and the man himself. Mircea was not best pleased by Its blasé view of the situation - going so far as to strike at It - and questioned what good a god of redemption that could never partake of its own gifts was.

The Morninglord endured his frustration without complaint, remaining enigmatic, though Its words implied some disappointment with Mircea championing Zariel’s ideals and cause. Once It had gone, Mircea spent the rest of the time his companions slept in contemplation.

Nox, on the other hand, spent his time snooping around *Satisfaction*. He found little of interest due to its skeleton crew, though he did note that Salome displayed a number of medals dating to her mandatory term of service in the Blood War, an action that was indicative of her personality.

In the “morning”, Apollo found that his senses had sharpened, bringing with it the physical change of golden draconic eyes. Marica was concerned that he might be subject to greater influence from the Fivefold Queen but he felt no different. Before they had much time to properly investigate the manner, Salome called out that they would be arriving shortly their destination.

Frostfound was not only reminiscent of the Fortress of Memories but of the temple the party had explored in Kintyre, as if one had been created in the style of the other. It was constructed out of a material that superficially resembled glass or crystal though it was neither. The doors were unbarred and the party entered without incident.

A small fountain with accompanying seating was set in the entrance hall and a single door leading further into the structure stood in the opposite wall. After a cursory examination of the fountain, the party moved beyond the door and into strange memories.

Each of the adventurers found themself in a domestic scene. Nox was hunting a dragon in a dense forest with a jaguar by his side. His quarry escaped but for an apprentice hunter the complexity of the chase held merit regardless. Marica was struggling to stay awake in the wee hours of the night while she studied for a practical examination on conjuration magic. Mircea was awkwardly reconnecting with a long-absent brother over the craft of weaving. Owing to the often changing interests of children, he was more interested in learning swordplay. Apollo was playing hide-and-seek with his many siblings on the farm.

Once they returned to awareness of themselves, they found that they had all been separated, despite passing through the same door at the same time. The rooms were mid-sized empty chambers lined with mirrors and filled with a light fog. Apollo and Marica did extensive experiments to determine the nature of what was happening to them, communicating their findings with sending. The entire space was suffused with preservative magic, though it did nothing to stop Marica from cutting through one of the mirrors. She sent an arcane eye beyond its confines but found only nothingness. Even so, the behaviour she and Apollo had observed was not consistent with a demiplane.

Having no other options, everyone stepped through the next door. Though they could not have known it, each of these memories was from the same time period. In the downtime between military deployments, Nox spoke with a rather rude boy who took a disparaging view of the mostly untrained masses who had been drafted into the war. Apollo found himself arguing with a force commander revising the strategy of a losing battle, having little option aside from rolling with the punches. Marica and Mircea were in the thick of combat, conjuring deadly storms and finding familiar faces on the other side of the lines of battle.

Again returned to the nondescript rooms, the party - excepting Mircea who simply charged forward - took further measures to map their circumstances. Nox walked backward through the door, finding himself returned to the memory of hunting that he had first experienced. Marica and Apollo meanwhile confirmed that their experiences were instantaneous, as Apollo sent a sending to Marica the moment she passed through the door and it only arrived after she had passed through the memory.

This third set of memories was more disparate than the previous two, seeming to have no particular theme to tie them together. Mircea was fleeing a castle of glass with a bloody sword in hand, distraught by some event that Mircea had no access to while trapped in the present moment of the memory. Apollo found himself in the midst of an elaborate ceremony where he was gifted a magical sword of bronze that whispered sweetly in his ear. Marica awoke from a brush with death to the presence of a deeply concerned man who clearly had worried about the prudence of the ritual she had undertaken.

Once more, they were returned to the rooms. By now, it had become clear that though the rooms were physically indistinguishable, each gave the impression of being different, like some trick of perspective. Apollo took a moment to use the appearance of the person he had been in the memory - reflected by the surface of the blade - to cast legend lore, leading to the realization that he had been embodying Kas, the vampire whom the party had interacted with briefly in the Shadowfel. According to mythological tales, his tale had been entwined with the meteoric rise of a powerful lich until some matter drove the two apart, leading to his banishment to the Shadowfel and his present circumstance.

It seemed that the only way out was through and so Nox again walked through his door backward and the others continued on. These were moments of transformation. Marica existed in the aftermath of a terrible battle that had destroyed everything, holding the whispering shards of a bronze sword. After an ill-conceived effort to restore what had been lost, she became certain it was pointless. Apollo should have been drowning in the dark waters of the Shadowfel but learned that no earthly trouble could move him - not hunger, not fatigue, not fear. He moved mechanically toward a great citadel of glass, having no other option.

Mircea stood in a city on the cusp of revolution. When the first fire was set, he followed his compatriots into the fray and even lent a hand to their efforts beyond the speech that he had delivered moments before. Nox experienced the last moments of a mortal life, not in death but in ascension, giving up limitations and pain but also all the other fruits of reality. Surrounded by the corpses of those who sought his destruction (who should have had his anger) and with his devastated wife sobbing at his feet (which should have prompted his sympathy), he seemed to simply stop existing as he once did.

Having passed through the final memories, the party was back in the room with the fountain, apparently having all came through the same single door. They quickly confirmed that they were all uninjured but before they could share much of their experiences they were interrupted by two new arrivals. A great undead dragon and its rider appeared through the main doors of Frostfound and demanded to know what four strangers were doing there.
