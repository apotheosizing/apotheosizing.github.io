# Session 30

Apollo recognized his childhood friend immediately and both were shocked to see the other in Carceri. Although some form of alarm appeared to have been set off by the destruction of the cell, the two quickly changed the basic details of their circumstances. Marica had been caught in the midst of attempting to obtain ichor - though her interest in it was purely academic.

The blaring of the alarm prompted the party to search for a means of escape. Staufen commented that the plane of Carceri was the prison entire and thus would present no mundane means of escape but the party had no other option but to explore. 

Aside from their own cells, there were many identical doors on the floor. There were no windows but any non-inmate who touched the door would be able to see through them. The first door they tried led to a room where several modrons were plugged into sockets along the wall. Mircea attempted to interrogate them to little effect, though the modrons did mention a warden who oversaw the plane.

Apollo, who had been keeping an ear out for any changes in the distance of the alarm, noted that it was growing closer. No sooner had they stepped outside the room than a pair of construct guards had reached their level. These guards were equipped with swords but their primary weapon were living spells that proved far more formidable than their wielders.

Despite a close call with Calanthir nearly being thrown off the tower by a Bigby's hand, the group were able to destroy the spells and their casters. They had sustained significant injuries, however, and the sound of another alarm ringing out through the complex spurred them to make their way to the lower levels quickly.

The adventurers circled the tower clockwise to find the personal effects lockers for inmates. Marica retrieved her belongings from the compact cube that had been stored in but they did not find one for Staufen. The spined devil himself confirmed that he did have one, prompting the realization that the lockers were labelled with prisoners' true names. The party went outside while Staufen opened his own cube.

Since they had a moment to breathe, Apollo and Marica took some time to catch up and Nox and Mircea introduced themselves. Once all were ready to press on, they examined the remaining doors. The last one they checked had a staircase that descended to the next floor. Their trek impressed upon them how tall the tower was, as their descent was easily a thousand feet.

Rather than risk more encounters with guards or other potential security measures, Marica offered to use her wild shape to transport the party to the bottom of the tower. She would only be able to take one of the two in armour but Mircea had a spell that would allow him to fall the distance without danger.

Mircea was the first to reach the ground, as he was falling rather than flying. He collided heavily with a marut which insisted that he had assaulted a guard. Mircea countered that he had not intended to do so and the marut deliberated on the matter for long enough that the rest of the party arrived.

The marut concluded that Mircea's sentencing should be carried out by the Warden and climbed out of the trench filled with such creatures to escort the party to the smaller tower in the centre of the plane. Given the circumstances, the adventurers had no choice but to comply.
