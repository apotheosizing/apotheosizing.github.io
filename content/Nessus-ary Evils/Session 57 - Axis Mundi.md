# Session 57

Shortly after Levistus had retreated beneath the waves of Stygia, the party felt a sense of foreboding creep over them. This strange feeling became a physical command to bow under the power of the Ruby Rod, wielded by none other than the Liege of the Nine Itself. At Its side was the angel the party had observed speaking with Faustus on one of their visits to Cania - It addressed the angel as Shemyaza, Its First Warlock.

The Liege of the Nine had previously issued a warning to Apollo and Nox of the consequences of defying a god but now the party had explicitly countermanded a divine edict by restoring Levistus. That could not stand without retaliation. It granted that they were bound by the clauses of their contracts with Glasya but It put a fine point on the fact that she had no true conception of what it was she was seeking to accomplish. Without the god who had formed the Nine Hells from the primordial muck of existence, the planes would collapse - though whether It meant that the archduxes would gleefully tear apart the Nine Hells in their ensuing power struggle or if the fabric of the planes would unravel remained unclear. The Liege of the Nine recommended that they make their next moves in this game with care before Shemyaza to address them on another matter.

With the pressure of the Ruby Rod no longer on them, the party was able to return to their feet and speak on more equal terms with the First Warlock of Nessus. Their interest was in Nox, who they informed was the highest-ranking warlock of Zariel the Magisterium had been able to confirm. As such, he would be expected to fulfil the duties of that position. Nox was always happy to receive greater accolades and so accepted. Shemyaza indicated that they would provide him further information on what was expected of him shortly. To the rest of the party, the angel indicated that their liege's mercy was not something to be taken lightly and that this would serve as their final warning. It then departed.

Before the party could discuss the significance of these developments, Iz - now captain - took the opportunity of the adventurers being flatfooted to order them off her ship. Marica folded them all into a rope trick to prevent them from being made to walk the plank, with the notion that she might be able to identify the attunement of Apollo's other planar forks and use one to travel out of Stygia.

One of the forks was known to allow travel to Cania but Hutijin had made it clear that the party was not welcome to return. The rest, Marica determined, were suffused with the power of the planes of Maladomini, Avernus, Mechanus, Pandemonium, Spirenzza, Arborea, and Gehenna. After some discussion, the party decided that Maladomini would be safe enough and Apollo cast the necessary spell to take them there.

Archdux Beelzebub's plane was a marked departure from the appearance of the other planes of the Nine Hells. Great efforts had been spared to cultivate greenery throughout the space and further attention had been paid to making the realm hospitable to non-devils. This was a fortunate turn of events, given that the party was seeking accommodations in which to recuperate, and obtaining rooms was a simple matter.

Without any urgent business to take care of, the party dedicated a few days to downtime. Apollo and Marica discussed the appearance of the Liege of the Nine - Kai for Apollo and herself for Marica, which led into a discussion of the shadows their storied parents cast over their accomplishments. In the end, the conversation turned to the problem of Avernus, though they came to no definitive conclusion.

Over the next several days, they made some purchases and availed themselves of the library of Maladomini. The bulk of its books were devoted to the complexities of Infernal law but all planes of the Nine Hells held information about the conflict between devils and seirim that defined the history of the planes. With Avernus on her mind, Marica delved into the records on the inciting incident of the Blood War.

Many believed that the conflict had no true beginning and had existed as an extension of an existential struggle between order and chaos. However, a few accounts attributed the start of the war to the Liege of the Nine's theft of the heart of a god known as the Chained Entropy, the seed of the Abyss whose heart was the Ruby Rod.

Nox, meanwhile, was keen to flaunt his rise in status to Artemy. He spent his time in Phlegethos, during which he learned of the plans Apollo had glimpsed Glasya's other agents devising in the palace of Proscenium. He indicated that he and his companions would soon be traveling to Avernus themselves and invited them to join the party. The four agreed.

Toward the end of their time in Maladomini, Mircea laid out a thought he had been considering with regard to how they might oust the seirim from Avernus. Rather than attempting to repel an army that Zariel themself could not defeat, they could use Eludecia's control over time to return to the past and prevent whatever Şenkă had done to subvert the plane. The rest of the party expressed some trepidation at seeking aid from Virgil but, considering that they would be inevitably finding themselves in Nessus if they continued to obey Glasya, Virgil would get what he wanted from them eventually.

Virgil, of course, was happy to assist. Being the only one of them to have manipulated time, he shared what he knew of its effects on the known universe - namely whether altering time would branch events off into an entirely new timeline, thus dooming the current one, or if it would create a causal loop that the party would need to carefully manage. He clarified that he had used Eludecia only to meddle with events in the recent past but he had concluded that the timeline was indeed singular.

This was fortunate for the party, as the lack of news in or out of Avernus meant that they might theoretically prevent the seirim from destroying it without contradicting the timeline. Zariel might not be pleased with being required to weaken her position by proscribing travel to the plane but it was a more recoverable state of affairs than the current fall of Avernus. Seeing no other option, the party decided to make the attempt, regardless of the potential consequences.
