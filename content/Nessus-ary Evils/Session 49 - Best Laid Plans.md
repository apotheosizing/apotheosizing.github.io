# Session 49

Over a breakfast the following morning that consisted of solely the five of them, the party made their various proposals for a means to deal with Titivilus. Nox believed that framing Titivilus for colluson with seirim was the only offence severe enough for Dispater to act. He suggested Mircea’s connection with Şenkă might be used to this end.

Mircea shot this idea down immediately. Apollo more diplomatically indicated that they had no means to contact Şenkă even if they were to attempt to do so. Nox’s alternative plan involved recalling the Wand of Orcus to the present which was likewise rejected.

Marica was convinced that their safest option would be to unearth some genuine crime on Titivilus’ part to present to the Liege of Dis. There was no doubt in the party’s minds that he had plenty of illicit dealings in his past. In fact, his assassination of a foreign envoy was the occasion of their first meeting. Although this method would stand up to the archdux’s scrutiny, it would be more difficult than a false accusation since Titivilus did not gain his position by being sloppy. Furthermore, as Beatrice pointed out, it would be their word against Titivilus’ unless they could find concrete evidence.

Eventually they concluded that their first step should be to isolate Titivilus’ bodyguard Vassago at the party. They might be able to plant something on him to carry into Titivilus’ vicinity or even be made to obtain something with Titivilus’ handwriting and seal so that they could forge his correspondence if it became necessary.

With the party two days away, Apollo focused all his efforts on copying down the mighty wish spell from Mordenkainen’s spellbook. Since he would be indisposed until the very moment of the party, Marica went out to purchase an appropriate outfit for him on the princeps’ dime. Nox tagged along and bought a frankly hideous outfit for Tangie that he hoped would ruin their reputation when he wore it.

Mircea, meanwhile, took the opportunity afforded to him by knowing how to cast sending to make contact with Zariel and, later, his family. Archdux Zariel did not respond to his message, though the spell did not fail. He had much better luck with his child Constantin who informed him that they and their mother were currently staying in the town of Apleso.

On an impulsive decision, Mircea plane shifted to the material plane to visit, interrupting Ezmerelda and Constantin at lunch in the town’s inn. After so long apart, Mircea was simply happy to be with his family for a time. They swapped stories about their recent exploits and, though Constantin made a somewhat troubling comment about having to deal with the Morninglord’s attention of late, it was generally a pleasant afternoon.

When he returned to Astaroth’s manor, he manifested inside Marica’s room. She was surprised to hear he had a family but then it occurred to her that such powerful magic as crossing between the planes unauthorized would draw Titivilus’ notice. She gathered up the rest of the party and fled after giving a warning to Astaroth that her house might soon come under investigation.

They opted to split up for the night with Mircea using Mordenkainen’s magic to make an appropriate sanctum while Marica and Apollo checked into a hotel. Nox, not requiring rest, decided to wander around Dis for the evening. Even when the curfew fell, he was not detected out of doors when he shouldn’t be. Nox even happened to cross paths with a devil of clearly high station (for they were walking the streets after curfew with no apparent circumspection) and overheard several petitions to intervene with Titivilus on behalf of the people of the city.

The first to return to the manor was Nox. He found himself face-to-face not with the majordomo of the estate but an irate Andrealphas who was clearly waiting for someone in particular. Apollo and Marica made their way back as well and Marica spoke to Andrealphas. They were awaiting the return of Astaroth, who had been summoned to the Iron Tower for questioning no long after the party absconded.

Mircea was the last to arrive, being waylaid by Titivilus and his bodyguard the moment he stepped out of his extradimensional space in the morning. Titivilus extended a thin veneer of courtesy and a warning to “Mordenkainen” that such a flagrant violation of the laws of the plane would not be overlooked twice. Mircea had to fend off an few divination spells before returning to the manor.

Once the party was reconstituted, they worked to finalize their plan for the party. Nox suggested a chain of spells using the relatively inconspicuous contingency that would allow Mircea to lay down a zone of truth without being obvious in order to get at least a few answers out of Vassago before he picked up on what was happening. Mircea performed the appropriate set up to ensure he would have the magic back by the following night.

At this point, he also realized he should have put himself under the effects of a nondetection spell. He did so - better late than never.

The arrival of Princeps Astaroth interrupted the meeting just as it was ending. Andrealphas seemed relieved by their presence but Astaroth themself was unflustered, saying that it had been the perfect opportunity to invite Titivilus to the party in person. Marica tried to listen in on the pair when they retreated to Astaroth’s office to no avail.

In the lead-up to the festivities, Nox asked Beatrice if she was still able to facilitate contact with Virgil. She was, since her form may have changed but she remained a familiar. Nox tentatively explained the difficulties the party would soon been confronting to Virgil, hoping he might offer some useful insight. The lich was all too happy to suggest that he could simply make this entire matter go away but Nox politely declined. Placing themselves further in Virgil’s debt would likely prove detrimental later on.
