# Session 2

Once they arrived at St. Christabel's, the group split in two - Dimble and Vana went to search the graveyard for the graves of the grim to use in banishing them while the rest headed in to the church building itself.

As it was a Saturday, the church was relatively quiet. Agnes, Nervoso, and Tanya explored the open rooms for a time until they found the pastor in the tabernacle. He was rather curt with them, denying their requests to examine the church's grounds and became more so when they dropped the fa√ßade and explained the circumstances of their encounter with the grim.

Negotiations were stilted, as neither side had much reason to trust the other, but Father Wells relented so much as to agree to perform a ritual that would exclude at least those being wrongfully hunted by the grim from their notice. He told Agnes and Tanya that the grim always acted as guardians of the church but he had sent them out to catch a succubus that he had connected to several recent attacks in downtown Beaugrand. Given the group's inexperience, he warned them against going after the succubus themselves, though if they intended to do so anyway he would assist them by lending out some of his tools.

While Agnes and Tanya spoke with Wells, Nervoso picked the lock on the pastor's office door and rifled through his effects. Many of his documents supported what he had told the other two but none of them indicated much about Wells himself, more revealing were the various weapons that he kept locked away from prying eyes. In a fit of fear that he might use them for ill purposes, Nervoso took as many of them as he could carry out. Unfortunately, he was unable to find anything in Wells' observations of the supernatural that matched the stalker he had seen on the bus.

The two groups reconvened outside the church to share what they had learned (save for Agnes, who had stayed with Wells at his request so that he could prepare her for a purification ritual that he insisted she undergo if he was to be offering protection to any person the group brought to him). It was unclear if they could really trust Wells unreservedly but there was no reason to turn down the solution he offered to the problem of the grim hunting Vana and her family. They also convinced Nervoso to return the things he had taken from Wells' office, if only so that the discovery that they were missing didn't sour the fragile ceasefire they had brokered.

Nerovso slipped back into the office with ease while the rest took Vana inside for the ritual. She found the church a little uncomfortable due to her vampiric heritage, though it was endurable if needed. It took only a few minutes for Wells to perform the spell and its effectiveness was obvious from the way the grim lowered their hackles upon its completion.

Vana invited the group back to Delmar Manor to speak with Minerva about what had transpired, claiming that they would all likely need to talk to her sooner rather than later. The four agreed and endured a somewhat awkward explanation of the grim attack and the deal they had made with Wells that Vana delivered to her grandmother. Wells was a known element to her and her mention that he had broken ties with the order he had once belonged to did little to ease the concerns of the group.

Like the priest before her, Minerva dismissed everyone except Agnes. She warned her that she was aware of the botched ritual she had attempted and said that a recurrence of that incident would not be tolerated. The others tried to ask Agnes what Minerva had said to her but she was avoidant.

With the rest of their day free, the group spent some time playing games with Vana. When everyone had gone home, Agnes and Vana had a brief discussion about the possibility that Agnes' odd encounter the night before was supernatural rather than a trick of the light. She knew as much as her grandmother about the matter and suggested that so long as Agnes was taking measures to protect herself, she would be fine. However, there were a few witchcraft clubs that she could look into if she wanted, though obviously not all members were true practitioners.

Sunday was a quiet day for most of the group, aside from Tanya. Vana contacted her by text to say that she had done some looking into sources she might consult about Alice's death and was willing to go with her to meet Old Lady Desmarais that afternoon, if Tanya was available. Despite being ostensibly a completely normal woman, Ms. Desmarais was well-known to the supernatural beings of the forest. She wasn't able to tell Tanya much about what had happened to Alice but Tanya remained determined to uncover the truth of the matter nonetheless.
