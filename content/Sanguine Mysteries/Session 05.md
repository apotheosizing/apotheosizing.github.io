# Session 5

During the rest of the week, the members of BGIS went about their business. Notably Agnes paid a visit to the other witchcraft club on campus. It was run by a girl named Artemisia Finch and had a much different atmosphere to the Children of Gaia. However, their level of magic practice was similar, making her choice between them more a matter of preference.

On Saturday, each of the four arrived at Gay Lighthouse to the sight of an extremely excited Vana. She had been entrusted with a significant responsibility by her mother, though she told the others that the details of the mission would best be discussed in private. Fortunately, Vana had an open invitation from the Harts for lunch that the five availed themselves of.

Devon welcomed the group and reiterated the rules of Lake Sanguine, both mundane and magical. Benji was more standoffish but he was willing to tolerate the students over their lunch hour. While they ate, Vana filled them in. She had been asked to mediate a dispute between a group of kelpies and sirens on behalf of BGIS - it was relatively low-stakes, all things considered, but she appreciated having her friends accompany her.

After lunch, the five headed out to the shore to meet their ride out to the island where the meeting would take place. A long snake-like creature emerged from beneath the waves which Vana introduced as Scylla. Scylla bore the group northeast to a small sand bar where the sirens and kelpies were already assembled.

Himerope and Ligeia, a pair of sisters, sat on a tree branch and the three kelpies assumed humanoid forms that made it clear that they were a young boy and his parents - Gregor, Una, and Herrick. Vana began by summarizing the sirens' complaint, namely that Ligeia's silver comb (which allowed her to take human form) had gone missing not long after spending time playing with Gregor on a nearby island. Gregor denied taking the comb but no one had been able to locate it, which suggested that it had been hidden or taken.

Tanya asked to speak with Ligeia and Gregor separately while Dimble and Agnes questioned Himerope about the nature of the comb. She told them that it would only work for Ligeia, prompting the question of why Gregor would take it. Himerope dismissively commented that he likely would have taken it simply because it was shiny.

A little ways from the meeting, Tanya established that Ligeia did not think that Gregor took the comb - they had been friends for many years and knew each other well. Himerope, however, insisted that it was him and according to Ligeia, her sister had always disliked that she and Gregor were friends. Tanya suggested that it was possible Himerope was framing Gregor for a crime she had committed but Ligeia insisted that Himerope wouldn't do something like that.

Eventually, Dimble jokingly suggested that they should ask if any fish had seen it after the comb had last been seen, but Vana was actually able to speak with marine animals. As such, she called several fish to the meeting site and asked for their testimony. A couple fish saw the children playing and noted that the bag in which Ligeia kept the comb was closed the whole time, which exonerated Gregor. However, the question of what had truly happened remained.

Like all magical items, the comb would leave traces, though they would be difficult to follow unless one was specifically trained in attuning to them. Vana was still willing to try and she was able to track down a magical signature to a nearby island, though it exhausted her greatly. The island itself was in walking distance but the comb itself appeared to be buried in the sand.

The members of BGIS returned to the lighthouse to borrow shovels from the Harts, which a somewhat skeptical Benji was eventually willing to relinquish. By the time they returned, only Himerope remained on the island, with the other attendees having returned home. It took considerable time and effort but the five were able to dig up the comb, which had curiously been buried in the box it came in. Dimble noticed that a broken-off nail or talon had been caught in the box's hinge, an observation made damning by Tanya's realization that Himerope had a chipped talon.

Agnes suggested using sympathetic magic to lay a minor curse of tongue-tying on the person responsible so that they could be identified. Himerope indicated that with the comb found she would be returning home but Vana and Tanya convinced her to stay while Agnes completed the ritual. The first thing the group did after the spell took hold was ask Himerope how her talon had gotten chipped and when Himerope tried to answer she found herself unable to coherently speak.

Clearly surprised that the spell had worked and knowing that she had been discovered, Himerope attempted to fly away. Tanya reached out to stop her but forgot that even a magical bird was still just a bird and, though Himerope was stopped from escaping, Tanya broke one of her wings in the process.

Dimble and Vana immediately tried to do what they could to mitigate the damage. As an EMT-in-training, Dimble had some idea of how to set the bone but he was unfamiliar with avian anatomy. In the absence of any other effective method, Vana used her magic to stabilize Himerope, overextending herself into unconsciousness. While Dimble continued to perform triage, Tanya took Vana over to the water to immerse her and restore her strength somewhat.

Scylla quickly arrived and telepathically asked Tanya what was wrong. Once she explained that Vana had not been hurt, Scylla calmed and awaited the rest of the group's decision on what to do next. They had few options, aside from taking Himerope home and hoping the sirens would have a better understanding of how to help her. Scylla knew where the sirens nested and she was willing to take them there.

Ligeia was horrified when the group brought her sister back to the nests and became no less so when Dimble explained what had happened. She understood that they had meant no harm, but she advised that they return to Beaugrand for the time being. Ligeia promised to contact them once Himerope had recovered enough to explain her motives.

On their way back to shore, Vana awoke and the group wondered just how much trouble they would be in with Minerva over the outcome of their mission, defusing the tension somewhat. Vana suspected that they would likely not be offered further tasks for some time, though ultimately it was up to Minerva how their mistake would be handled.

Three days later, the group reconvened at the sirens' nest to speak with Himerope. She reluctantly explained that she had stolen the comb in order to exchange it with a wizard who had contacted her with the intention of procuring a magically-infused item to be used to fuel some grand spell. The comb in particular had been her target because she disliked Ligeia's use of it, playing at being human, and she hoped that its loss would put an end to such behaviour. She was intending to meet the wizard at the spot where the comb was buried to hand it over in two days time, which gave the group some time to make preparations to go in her place.

On the appointed day, they returned to the island but there was no wizard present to receive them. Nervoso spotted the approach of an owl, which dropped a letter at his feet before flying away. It was stamped with golden wax that created a seal of a tree branch, which the group couldn't place as a family crest or otherwise significant symbol. The letter explained that the wizard had no intention of meeting them and essentially told them to back off unless they wanted to face his wrath. It was signed with nothing more than the letter T.

Inspired by what Vana had done with the comb, Agnes suggested that they attempt to trace the letter's origin with magic. She volunteered Nervoso for the task, as he had previously indicated some interest in learning magic, and under Vana's direction he was able to follow back the faint remnants on the letter to its source.

It was like looking up underwater, with the voices of the two people at whom the magical trail ended completely indecipherable, but he was able to make out a few things. A metal corridor ladden with numbered doors flew past his vision as the pair walked. One of them was an older man, gaunt and pale, wearing a labcoat and glasses. His companion was younger than him, conspicuous with her red hair and red dress beneath her own labcoat. They stepped through a door labelled 601 and Nervoso saw the faintest hint of someone behind the door before being returned to his own body, bringing with him many more questions than answers.
