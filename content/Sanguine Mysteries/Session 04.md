# Session 4

Unlike his friends, Nervoso did not sleep well that night. He awoke suddenly in the darkness and found that he couldn't move, save blinking. The tall figure he had seen on his bus ride Friday night, wearing a bowler hat and a red suit, was staring through his seventh floor window. There was nothing he could do to react until the figure disappeared. He quickly closed the blinds and tried to return to his rest, though he had little luck.

Each of the group had classes in the morning, which they attended without significant incident, though Dimble had a strange moment where someone leaving the lecture hall before his class warned him to check his seat before he sat down. He chose his seat at random without looking and found that there was gum stuck to it.

Around noon, Agnes sent a message to the others informing them that she would be attending a meeting of one of the campus' two witchcraft clubs on Tuesday. Dimble, Nervoso, and Tanya expressed their interest in attending, meaning that everyone except Vana would be in attendance.

Monday evening was just as uncomfortable for Nervoso as the last. The figure was now standing inside his room, in defiance of the closed curtains. When Nervoso broke free from his paralysis, he left his room to sleep in the chapel until just before it was open for student use.

The group met up outside the room in the Sussex Hall basement where the Children of Gaia held their meetings. The club itself consisted of four members, one of whom Dimble recognized as the person who spoke to him as he headed into his class on Monday. A girl with blue hair who was clearly the leader of the club greeted them as they entered and introduced herself as Mary.

The meeting itself was rather simple, with members of the club sharing things that they wanted magical help with such as upcoming tests and casting spells to influence the outcome. Agnes evaluated it as being based in a different foundation than the magic she had done before but figured that it was likely a real form of it all the same.

After the formal meeting time was over, Dimble spoke to the person who had spoken with him to ask if they had the gift of prophecy. They denied it, saying that it was just that they found themselves knowing things without explanation. Nervoso summoned the courage to tell the group about his nightly visitor, which drew some concern from the members of the Children of Gaia as well. Tanya offered to stay over at Nervoso's house to try to dissuade the creature from appearing but Mary suggested that they talk to Cass about what was happening.

Cass, as it turned out, was the person Dimble had been talking to. They did not seem very surprised by Nervoso's situation and offered to examine his room for any clues about the being's motives and nature. The group followed along, leading to the bizarre scene of Nervoso, who never interacted with anyone at all, bringing four people to his room.

Cass took a turn of the room and concluded that the creature likely had malicious intentions toward Nervoso. They also noted that the protection charm he was wearing was clearly not effective and thus it was neither a demon nor a spirit. After some discussion with the others, the five decided that it would be best for them to stay up tonight while Nervoso slept and await the appearance of the figure. They decided that Dimble's place would be the best place to stage the encounter, since he was the only member of the group who didn't share his space with a roommate.

Just after 3 AM, the figure appeared at the foot of the bed, but this time Nervoso was not facing it alone. Only Nervoso was able to see the creature, which hampered the party's ability to fend it off. However, Cass was able to use their abilities to free Nervoso from its influence, allowing him to direct them into pushing it into a corner of the room. Cass held it in place long enough for Agnes to place a salt circle around it to keep it from escaping or harming them.

Soon after, the creature surrendered and proposed a truce to Nervoso. He explained that he was feeding on Nervoso's fear since it was so readily available but it was obvious that Nervoso was more trouble than he was worth. As long as Nervoso did not harm him, he would likewise leave Nervoso alone. He agreed and the creature disappeared. With the crisis averted, the group slept.

In the morning, Agnes took a look through Dimble's things under the thinnest pretense, drawing Nervoso's attention. He confronted her about it and she explained that she wanted to make sure that, after something like this happening to Nervoso, Dimble didn't have any secretly cursed artifacts lying around.  Nervoso also asked her if she had any idea what kind of creature they had dealt with. Agnes figured that it was likely a faer dearg. This lent its promise a certain degree of weight that meant Nervoso would likely be safe, since it was a faerie.

On her way home, Agnes received a text from Ru telling her to stop whatever she was trying to do. She claimed that she didn't know what they were talking about and eventually convinced them that she really didn't know what they meant. Ru explained that they had gotten a message from Michael, which should have been impossible. Agnes sent a message to that number and received a response, unsettling her into turning off her phone for the rest of the day.

Back at her place, Tanya was given one of the new Elcon digital assistants by her roommate Andy. She set up ELSIE to play music (specifically to loudly Rick Roll her friend) but otherwise left most of its features unused. The ensuing conversation about digital assistants in the group chat led to the group at large informing Vana about their adventure in her absence. She told them that she had been busy with BGIS work near Gay Lighthouse and invited them to meet her there for reasons that she wanted to keep secret until they met up.

Later that day, Agnes met briefly with Father Wells to update him on the recent supernatural events of the past couple days and before going to visit Kiss at A Little Slice of Paradise alongside Vana. He was settling into his new living situation fairly well and beginning to learn how to properly use his abilities. They spent the rest of the day playing Switch games, as was becoming traditional among the group.
