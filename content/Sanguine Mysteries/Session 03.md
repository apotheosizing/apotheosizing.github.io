# Session 3

As the day wore on, Vana posted a message in the Discord chat asking if they had any plans to deal with the matter of the succubus. The group discussed the matter, concluding that while they did want to do something to stop the demon, they had little in the way of weaponry if things turned violent. Agnes brought up Father Wells' offer to lend them equipment if they were going to proceed in such a manner and headed to the church after noon to speak with him. In the meantime, Dimble had received the salt gun he had purchased from Elcon.ca and started purchasing a truly horrible team uniform (sunglasses and flame-decal shirts) for the five of them.

Father Wells was not especially pleased by Agnes delivering the news that the group - three of whom had no idea that the supernatural existed until two days ago - would be hunting the succubus but he provided what information he had obtained from the police reports. There had been three victims thus far, all of whom seemed to have little in common aside from their patronage of the club Aura and had all left with different people.

His own research indicated that the succubus was staying on the university campus, though he was unable to pinpoint their exact location. He also gave Agnes a bottle of holy water in the event that it was needed. She took the opportunity to ask why he had left his previous order and, though he was not pleased with how she phrased it, he told her that he had left because they were too extreme in their dealings with supernatural creatures.

She passed this information along to the rest of the group, who concluded that the easiest way to track down the succubus was to be caught as a mark. Tanya was willing to act as the bait and the rest of the group would follow her and the succubus when they left the club to ambush them.

Later that night, the five convened at Aura. Vana mentioned that her uncle Anthony often could be found in the VIP area, which piqued Dimble and Tanya's interest. They headed upstairs with her while Agnes and Nervoso parked themselves at a table to keep an eye out for any suspicious individuals mingling with the other patrons.

Anthony was indeed present at the club that night, seated with its owner Magnolia Benson and several businessmen and embroiled in some discussion that broke off when his niece arrived. Dimble inquired about how to get into the VIP section but was firmly rebuffed by Magnolia, who said that they curated a very select clientele for the VIPs. However, she said they were welcome to catch up with Anthony before switching to French to continue her earlier discussion.

Down on the dancefloor, Agnes was able to pick out two people who appeared to be canvassing for people. One was a young woman who seemed to be going from table to table attempting to make friends with anyone who would listen while the other was a young man sitting at the bar and flirting with every single person who passed by. She and Nervoso split up to speak to each of them, with Agnes heading to the bar while Nervoso went toward the girl.

Nervoso learned in rapid succession that the girl's name was Ophelia, that she was a first-year student at BU who had moved to Beaugrand from New York, and that she was extremely excited to meet anyone at all - even Nervoso who was so overwhelmed by her friendliness that he could barely get a word out. He gave her his email address in lieu of a phone number and promised to get in touch with her at some point. Fortunately, Tanya was able to notice that he was being buffeted by conversation and came down from the balcony to distract her and allow Nervoso to eventually escape.

Agnes spoke to the boy at the bar, who told her he was alone tonight due to a recent breakup. She sympathized with his situation, having recently gone through something similar herself. Though she exaggerated the circumstances, she told the tale of her podcast falling apart a few months ago and he seemed completely sympathetic despite how weird that story was. It didn't take long for him to suggest they leave the club and Agnes quickly messaged the rest of the group to tell them what was happening.

They followed at a slight distance as Agnes led him to nowhere in particular, distracting him from their presence by talking about her recent studies. The group was hesitate to essentially take him into an alley and attack him without any conclusive proof that he was the succubus so Vana took the time to read his aura to see if he was indeed a supernatural being. She gave the group her verdict by texting them "succ alert XD" and Agnes led him down one of the nearby streets soon after.

The succubus was caught completely off-guard by Agnes and Dimble, who threw salt at him the moment they were out of the public eye. Contact with salt caused heavy burns, allowing Vana to make a set of ice manacles to keep him in place while the group questioned him. He told them that the three deaths were accidental, as he had neither the experience nor the frequency of feeding (since he refused to use mind control to ensnare them) to ensure that he could take non-lethally from his victims. Tanya could tell that he was being truthful which quickly took killing him off the table. Since they no longer had any idea what to do, Dimble called Father Wells and asked for him to come meet them where they had the succubus trapped.

After a few minutes of absolute chaos caused by the fact that the five of them barely knew each other and had no real team cohesion, they learned that the succubus' name was Kiss and dragged him into a meandering conversation that went from the ethics of manslaughter to how many times Agnes read Death Note (twice). By the time Father Wells arrived, things had mostly calmed down. He recommended that if Kiss was truly repentant, he could learn to feed safely from an associate of his named Ariel. Kiss agreed and Wells gave the group a package to deliver to her during their visit to the bookstore she ran.

Fortunately, it was open late enough that they could head there directly. The group chipped Kiss out from the ice chains and the six of them all piled into their vehicles and headed to A Little Slice of Paradise. Ariel, who was a nephilim, was willing to teach Kiss, though she seemed rather stern through their discussion. Tanya figured that was simply her usual demeanour and that Kiss was not in any real trouble so long as he tried earnestly to learn from her.

With their task done, the group parted ways and returned home for the night, as all of them had classed to attend in the morning.
