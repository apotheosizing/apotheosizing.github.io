# Session 1

Across the city of Beaugrand, four students of the university received a letter inviting them to the Beaugrand Geologic Interest Society's first meeting of the year. The meeting was to take place the following evening, leaving some time to research the organization beforehand. Some cursory googling revealed that their primary interest was the two-foot rise in the water level of Lake Sanguine and that though they were no longer officially affiliated with the university, the Delmars were significant donors to the institution.

In a slow procession, Dimble, Tanya, Nervoso, and Agnes all arrived to the meeting. It was essentially a mixer, during which both the members of BGIS and the potential new members evaluated each other. The head of BGIS, Minerva Delmar, spoke tersely to each of the four in turn, clearly sizing each of them up as she did. Her daughter Vana was more personable and made a follow-up invitation to them to meet with her tomorrow at Dr. Asha Ren's lab to discuss her current research for the society. Each of them agreed, having enough interest for at least one further meeting.

On his way home, Nervoso had a strange encounter. He was certain that someone was watching him on the mostly-empty bus and though he wasn't able to get a clear look at his stalker, he caught sight of the hat they were wearing before they disappeared. Likewise, Agnes had a moment where she thought she saw someone behind her who couldn't possibly be there. Both should have been easily dismissed in the light of day.

The following day brought fair weather for a Saturday out. The four arrived to the campus in the morning and made their way to the marine biology labs where Vana was working. She discussed what she had discovered so far about the changing circumstances in the lake until she was interrupted by two howls. Outside the door to the lab, two massive black dogs with red eyes were pacing, smoke curling up from their paws.

Dimble reacted first, managing to jam the door shut with a chair and buy them all time to locate an escape route. Unfortunately, the only real option was the window at the back of the classroom and a two-storey drop to the pavement below. Nervoso went out first, rolling his ankle in the landing but otherwise not sustaining any major injuries. As he went, Vana used the water in one of the specimen tanks to freeze the door in place, a feat that seemed no more bizarre in that moment than the creatures that were attacking them.

Although the dogs attempted to break through the icy barrier, everyone was able to get out through the window before they did and immediately began making their way to their cars. On the way, Vana was able to heal Nervoso's ankle as though he had never hurt it, which the group likewise had no time to question. As they ran, the dogs pursued. One managed to clamp its jaws around Vana's leg, leaving a significant bite wound after she fought it off to reach the safety of Agnes' car.

While they drove away, Vana gave enough of an explanation to make it clear that her powers were no surprise to her, but it was clear that she would soon lose consciousness from the blood loss without treatment. Agnes and Tanya both pulled over to a sidestreet where Dimble was able to use his abilities as an EMT-in-training to patch Vana up.

With the immediate crisis averted, they drove to Tanya's place to have a proper discussion about what had happened. Vana explained that she was a fledgling witch and that BGIS was not just a geological society but the primary arbitrator between Beaugrand's various supernatural residents. Though they would have otherwise been hard-pressed to believe her, they had seen the evidence of what she was saying with their own eyes.

She further suggested that the dogs were likely church grim that were after her due to the fact that she was a dhampir. Not only Vana but the rest of the Delmars that the group had met the prior evening would be in danger if the grim remained at large, being that most of them had vampiric heritage as well.

After giving Vana a chance to recover, during which the others mostly expressed their general disbelief about the past hour, they agreed to help Vana in dealing with the grim - if only to make sure it wouldn't attack them again. They decided to try looking at St. Christabel's parish first, since it was closer. On the drive over, Tanya asked Vana if she knew anything about the death of one Alice Haywood, suspecting that perhaps something supernatural might have been involved in event, but Vana couldn't shed much light on the matter.
