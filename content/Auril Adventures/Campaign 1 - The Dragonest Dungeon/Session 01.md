# Session 1

The carriage ride that was intended to transport the party to the hamlet bordering the House of Man was stopped short when it derailed, the caretaker who was driving nowhere to be seen. After climbing out of the wreckage, the party was set upon by a group of bandits and their wolf. They were able to defend themselves against the surprise attack and make the rest of the journey to the hamlet on foot. When they arrived, they were greeted by the caretaker who claimed that his disappearance was a function of the malevolent magic that had invaded the place thanks to the former master of the estate’s dabbling in the dark arts. He offered the party rooms at the inn and told them to join him at the manor proper once they were prepared to embark.

In doing so, they had a brief conversation with the blacksmith, who indicated that few of the prospective inheritors who had tried to clear the house of its evil had come back alive. Undeterred, the party set off into the house the next morning, warned by the caretaker that its rooms were prone to shift around. After exploring a few rooms of the decrepit house, the party did battle with some zombies and skeletons who had taken up residence in the place. After narrowly avoiding a trap in the following hall, the party came to a room with a door to go through, as well as a tunnel in the wall leading below. Deciding to explore the next room first, the party ended up in battle against two zombie ogres and their entourage, managing to get out of a tough spot by blocking the hallway with the corpse of one of the ogres.

On traveling down, the party entered a dining room filled with food which managed to compel Mary to eat from it, although Vyrana and Eve were able to pull her away before any damage could be done. In a small closet nearby, the party found a locket with a picture of a woman named Estelle, which they took with them before entering the final room they could reach, which housed a wight and its underlings. Upon their defeat, the party discovered what had become of Estelle, who had been sacrificed by the owner of the estate. With no path forward, the party returned to the entrance of the house, finding out that the several hours they had been within the house’s walls was three days for the world outside it. Returning to the hamlet, defying the expectations of the residents, the party rested from their trials, dreaming ominously of a void.
