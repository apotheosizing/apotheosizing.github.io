# Session 6

This time, the party’s point of entry into the estate was a spiral staircase, leading down into an elaborate sewer system. Making use of bridges that connected the two walkways on either side of the sewage itself, they made their way to the northern branch of the sewer. A room containing three chests was found at the end of this section, which the party checked for traps without much success - setting one off and unveiling one of the chests as a mimic. It was joined by a slithering tracker that emerged from one of the puddles below and attacked the party. Once the monsters were defeated, they were able to retrieve some magic scrolls and potions, along with some gold. Doubling back, the party took a passageway leading to what was once the servants’ quarters, allowing the group to fulfill their promise to the caretaker to retrieve his belongings, notable among them a holy symbol of Bhaal and a brass pocket watch.

Past the rest of the rooms was the entrance to a small system of caverns, where the party was able to perceptively spot a gelatinous cube lurking in the shadows and surprise it instead, though it was soon joined by an ochre jelly that they had to contend with as well. Taking the path to the upper left, the group reached a room that appeared to be a sculpting room, filled with eerily lifelike statues, two of whom attacked as they passed back to the lower half of the room after confirming the north door led back to the sewer. Two animated armours joined the fray not long after but all four were defeated by the party. The room to the south was a mortuary of sorts, holding the remains of those the old man had used in his experiments. Passing through it without any trouble, they reached a section of forest which also posed no danger to the group. A small connecting room led both forward and back to the tunnel system and the party decided to backtrack to ensure they hadn’t missed anything in the lower half of the caverns. No monsters were found, but they were able to dig out a chunk of amber from the walls.

The final room was occupied by five servants who were sitting at a dining table, chatting amongst themselves. Eve and Korvias took a seat at the table, despite Vyrana’s misgivings, and attempted to convince the servants that they were fellow employees of the old man. The woman at the head of the table seemed to believe their stories but soon revealed her true colours by charming Vyrana and Korvias. A battle ensued when Eve attacked with a Moonbeam and through the course of the battle the party was able to determine that the five servants were all the emanations of an adult oblex hiding behind a tapestry at the end of the room.

Despite multiple memory drains and an unsettling knowledge of their pasts in combination with what was a tough fight in its own right, the party was able to kill the oblex and thus its puppets and proceed into the final room, which held only several daises of slime and ooze. With no further branches to explore, the group returned to the town, though not before returning the caretaker’s things to him, and took a well-deserved day off. By selling the magical items they had found in the house to Melissa, the proprietor of the shop who had recently arrived in town, they were able to pull together enough money for the blacksmith to order better tools and spent the rest of their day sparring with Nova.
