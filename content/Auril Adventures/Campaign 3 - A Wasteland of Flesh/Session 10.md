# Session 10

After her conversation with Eva, AIDA shared her concerns about Eva’s behaviour with Mary and Scrimblo. Both agreed that it was something that they should keep an eye on going forward, even Scrimblo who had reason to hate the cult of Purity.

The following morning, Eva informed the others of her actions herself, including the Priest’s final fate. Though she admitted that this outcome was unfortunate and she would not be pursuing this avenue of research, she was not remorseful for her actions. This did not sit well with her companions but there was little to be done about the matter.

In light of recent events, the party decided to charter use of the Javelin II to travel to the Bastion. As they traveled east toward the forest they found a strange swordswoman wandering the wastes. She gave her name as Rend and indicated that she too was seeking to reach the Bastion of Purity. Scrimblo noted that she had a symbol belonging to a group known as the Rangers among those on her cloak and asked if she was working on their behalf. Rend denied any affiliation with them. She told the group that she was seeking out the members of the cult in order to battle them simply for the thrill of combat itself.

Despite her unorthodox perspective, it was evident that she was a competent fighter and could be an asset in their assault on the Bastion. As such, they offered her passage on the Javelin. Rend accepted, though she seemed uninterested in sharing much more than her name and goal with the adventurers.

On the horizon, a massive tree loomed over the dead forest. Once, Scrimblo said, the tree had been known as Beacon but it was now infested by the Flesh and Its worshippers. Hale landed the Javelin at the edge of the forest in order to minimize the possibility of being discovered during their infiltration. Rend was not pleased by the party’s cautious pace and simply took the most direct path toward Beacon.

Groups of cultists were working to transform the forest and remove the remaining fae from their homes. In their battles against the cultists, the party found themselves aided by another mysterious archer. AIDA and Eva attempted to find and communicate with this individual. Although they were unable to locate them, they learned that they were a member of the Rangers. They warned the party that Rend was merely a shell controlled by her sword before disappearing.

A tower occupied by brownies and a bridge guarded by a spirit of the wood were some of the dead forests’ only holdouts against the encroaching Purity cultists and both were grateful for the party’s assistance. A small patch of verdant ground protected by the forest spirit was, perhaps, one of the only surviving areas of Zeta’s original landscape. AIDA and Eve took cuttings of the flowers preserved there with the hope that they might be able to cultivate them elsewhere on the disc.

At the foot of Beacon, the adventurers found a small community of humanoid beings grown directly from the Flesh. A number of adult fleshkin were teaching children how to shapechange under the supervision of a cultist, to all appearances content as any other village. Rend immediately voiced her intention to attack the fleshkin to draw out cultists in their defence but fortunately the party managed to talk her out of a massacre. Carefully, the party avoided detection until they could reach the innards of Beacon.

The walls of the tree were covered in pods, each of which contained a blue liquid that gave off a syrupy scent when punctured. Eve and AIDA theorized that these were being used to create the fleshkin, though the purpose of doing such a thing remained unclear. In disguise, Mary and Eve were able to speak with those they came across in the outer chambers before the party attacked them, though none had any insights into the plans of the higher priests. Given their effective domination of the disc, it seemed that there was little hurry to accomplish their ends.

Rend began to express her annoyance with the weakness of their opponents, prompting the party to take the central hallway they had been avoiding. Sure enough, this main route led directly into the court of the cult. Three finely attired priests watched over a small congregation of cultists who were meditating while in contact with spines that protruded from the Flesh around them. Four guards ensured that no harm would befall the faithful in their vulnerable state and each of them turned to protect their charges from the intruders in their midst...
