# Session 16

After the party regrouped in the town square outside the castle, they observed an unsettling event. One of the carts transporting the dead to the temple was run off its course by one of the passengers rising as an undead. The party rushed to assist the driver and slew the few zombies that had climbed out of the pile of bodies. Their task was made more difficult than usual as they could not use any magic or weapons that might puncture the suits the zombies wore but overall the battle went smoothly.

As thanks, one of the acolytes assisting in collecting the dead provided some information about this phenomenon. From time to time, some of the afflicted would rise as zombies before they could be revived. Eve asked why the dead weren’t consecrated and the acolyte admitted that many people refused to report deaths in their households because they would simply be resurrected back into a miserable life working the fields or the mines.

The acolyte also made a request that the adventurers clear out the crypt. In the early days of the plague they had not known better than to bury those who died. When it became clear that some were becoming undead, the resources of the church were stretched too thin to allow anything other than boarding up the entrance. If they could remove any threats inside, it would be one less thing for the healers to worry about.

The party was not wholly convinced that the woman the king had offended was at fault and so they were willing to take on the task. Only when the staircase leading down into the crypt crumbled beneath their feet did they realize what they were in for. The plunge was directly into a pit of sharp spikes - presumably a means of deterring thieves - that Eve, AIDA, and Mary all fell into but they were able to extract themselves without suffering further harm.

Out in the catacombs, swirling mist covering the floor and dead candles in every niche made visibility especially poor. A chandelier nearly fell on Eva, too, making it clear that the degradation of the tomb itself might prove dangerous. Still the party pressed forward to examine the loculi on the walls.

A loud banging from one of the coffins drew the party south, where they learned that the unquiet dead were not exempt from the progression of the plague. The body buried in the coffin had liquefied into an ooze that lept out to attack them. After they fended off the ambush, the party came to the conclusion that the damage to the structure of the crypt was likely from the slow wear of the slimes attempting to escape to the surface. Numerous holes worn into the floor and ceiling made this clear.

Fortunately for the group, the crypt itself was relatively small. Even with blocked passages forcing them through side-chambers and a number of unfriendly encounters with slimes and oozes, it took only about an hour to fully explore the space. At the east wall of the tomb they found the creature that had been pulling the strings of the lesser oozes: an oblex that lured them into its chamber with the intent of consuming them.

For all its time to feast on the dead, the oblex was unable to stand up to a full assault by the party, who had no reason to hold back as they had against the zombies. However, as they made to return to the surface, Eve noticed that she had begun to feel poorly. Suddenly, she realized that the spike trap at the entrance to the crypt had torn her suit and she had been infected with the Dripping Rot. None of the other members of the party had contracted the Rot and the symptoms could be managed until they found a way to cure the disease but it was a worrying development.

Having traveled all the way from Scrimblo to the volcano and then taken care of all this business in Agranic in one day, the party decided to spent the rest of the afternoon resting. Eve stayed with Kijenor in the city to prevent exposing the crew of the Javelin to the plague, leaving the others to return without her. While they touched base with Hale and company, they overheard the guards who had been set to watch the Javelin complaining about how boring it was, though at least they didn’t have to deal with the growing unrest at the mines.

The next morning, AIDA appealed to the Lord of Flowers for aid in determining a solution to the plague. He told her that the plague was brought into the city through the waterways and bestowed upon her a sapling to plant at the source when it was found. The tree would grow there and weaken the plague so that it could be cured by standard magical means.

Uncertain where the city got its water, AIDA made a quick stop at the castle to inquire. Although she requested a meeting with the king, the archbishop was the one who came out to meet her. The two bickered over their gods’ primacy but he grudgingly informed her that Agranic sourced its water from underground aquifers, as the river water was too polluted by runoff from the farms by the time it reached the city.

All signs seemed to point to the mines. However, the mines were the only place where the city could extract the platinum required by Waukeen to fund the many, many resurrections being done throughout Agranic. They were heavily patrolled by a contingent of guards who had no intention of allowing the party entrance. Mary, actually showing restraint considering her usual method of problem-solving, threatened one of them, prompting hostilities.

The moment it became clear that the guards were not going to win the fight, one of them sent up a flare to call for reinforcements. Eva was able to mask it with an illusion but not before the nearby watchtower had spotted it. Eve was able to convince them that it had simply been a misfire and get them to turn around while the rest of the party knocked out the entire entire at the entrance of the mine.

They would only have so long before the guards awoke and came after them, so they had to move quickly, grabbing a few uniforms for disguises and heading into the platinum mines.
