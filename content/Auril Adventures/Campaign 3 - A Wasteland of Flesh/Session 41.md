# Session 41

Unlike many of the other guilds of Aetra, the grove of the druids was a small overgrown building. Eve was able to gain the party entry by addressing the voice that called out upon their arrival in druidic. The archdruid met with the party in the inner garden and told them what the druids knew of the mountain. Observation had revealed that it appeared to be of a different mind than the main body of the Flesh.

Like all of the malignant Flesh, it grew out of the earth during the apocalypse and began slowly moving toward Aetra. Eve asked them if there was anything in particular about Aetra that might be drawing it to the city. They could not be certain but the concentration of people and magic was - other than perhaps Elbarai - highest on the disc in Aetra. No one from the city had gone to the mountain itself so further information would need to be gaining in person.

As for the problem of Aetra itself, the archdruid suggested, though not in so many words, that it might be more prudent to ask for forgiveness rather than permission with regard to destroying the mountain. Aetra would adapt to its loss, as it always had. With this in mind, the party departed for the mountain.

The approach to the foot of the mountain revealed that not only were the creatures of Flesh that Aetra had been hunting sporing off its base, strange features were developing around it - familiar structures and landscapes that replicated the appearance of the hamlet, with the statue of Jebediah Mann at its center. Landing in the town square revealed that this "statue" was both animate and sentient. The last remnants of Jebediah Mann, the bare portion of him that had made contact with the Flesh before the inheritors destroyed him and stopped his ritual, welcomed his old enemies and their new allies to his lands.

The influence of Jebediah explained Constanze's enmity with the mountain, as he had wrenched control of this portion of the Flesh from her for his own ends. Those ends, at the moment, were revenge against the inheritors who had foiled his plans so long ago. In the spirit of his original task for the inheritors, he invited them to return to his manor once more and face his trials anew. In exchange, he would destroy the mountain from within.

The party agreed but, of course, Jebediah had no intention of keeping his word. The manor attempted to consume the party the moment they stepped inside and only by escaping in cloud form did they manage to free themselves. Now alerted to the presence of his adversaries in Aetra, the mountain, sprouting fetal arms and legs, moved far more quickly toward the city than before. If they desired the aid of Aetra, the party would have to gain it in short order.

Back in Aetra, the party was forestalled by a commotion. A number of rowdy adventurers were spilling out of a crowded tavern that advertised a contest of strength. A petrified gorgon impaled with a crystalline shortsword had been placed at the center of the tavern and the game was to pull the sword free. This by itself would not be of much consequence to the party but they were surprised to find that the gorgon was familiar: she resembled Maeveiane and was likely one of her missing mothers.

Certain that there was some kind of trick to the sword, the party examined the sword closely. Scrimblo noticed a thin line of clear material around the entrance wound and Eve concluded that it was likely Sovereign Glue, a famously strong adhesive that ordinarily could not be broken. However, in a city full of adventurers, there was likely an artificer or two who could sell them a solvent. Some searching in the merchant quarter found a shop that sold oil of etherealness, which would banish the glue from the material plane for long enough to retrieve the sword. On the return journey to the tavern, the party saw a small group of concerned citizens decrying that a murder had seemingly been committed. Probably ~~Mary~~ nothing.

Owing to his Flesh-warping abilities, Scrimblo was able to disguise the vial of oil and apply it without arousing suspicion and, indeed, the sword was easy enough to remove once the glue was gone. The assembled crowd erupted into cheers but the proprietor, Gildan, who knew very well that Scrimblo's accomplishment should have been impossible, drew him aside ostensibly to give him his winnings but in actuality to question him on how he had managed to pull the sword free. Seeing no reason to pretend he did not know about Gildan's scheme, Scrimblo explained. Gildan told him that he was willing to give Scrimblo a portion of the winnings and the sword - an heirloom that had been in his family for years until he had used it to slay the gorgon. Unfortunately, this fact boded poorly for Gildan given that Eve was at that very moment reviving Phedra.

The unexpected appearance of a furious gorgon caused a stir among the tavern's patrons that drew the attention of the bouncers and, while Eve and Phedra made their escape, Scrimblo grabbed the cashbox from a stunned Gildan and met the pair outside. In order to expedite their flight, Eve transformed into a dragon and made as the crow flies for the Hell's Reach mountains to the north. On the journey there, Eve and Scrimblo explained to Phedra their relationship with Maeveiane and assured her that her daughter was safe, though she had lately faced great hardship in Agranic.

Phedra, in turn, explained that she had been in Aetra searching for her wife Therris. She suspected that she had been imprisoned in order to grant the wishes of some adventurer but she had not narrowed down a particular person before she'd been attacked by Gildan. The party, concerned about letting her return to the city, promised to find and free Therris themselves. Phedra was immensely thankful to the party for their aid, and even more so for contacting Maeveiane on her behalf so that they could be reunited.

The party decided it would be best to wait until they were certain Phedra was safe before returning to the city and so they passed a pleasant afternoon in the company of the werebears, though the movement of the Flesh on the horizon kept them from true peace of mind as they waited.
