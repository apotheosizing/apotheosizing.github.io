# Session 12

With their rest completed, the party left the innards of the tree to address the problem of scaling Beacon. Between polymorph and wildshape, Athena and Eve were able to fly everyone up to the top of the tree. The skies above the great tree were shrouded in unearthly fog but a hooded figure could be faintly seen through the mist.

She immediately pulled back her hood to reveal the face of Constanze. She berated the adventurers for wiping out the cult of Purity, indicating that the cult would be rebuilt in time as others came to true understanding of the Flesh.  The party, as usual, ignored her and she soon departed, leaving them to deal with the leader of the cult.

Beyond the barrier of fog bloomed a grove of Flesh, topped with grasping hands and whipping winds that surrounded a lone figure. The minotaur Longhorn greeted the party civilly, entreating them to listen to his philosophy. After many years of meditation and contact with the heart of Auril, he came to realize that there is no distinction between people and the world on which they lived. The incursion of the Flesh was only a sign to convey this truth.

However, the priesthood of the cult of Purity had misconstrued his teachings for their own ends. It was for this reason that he did not feel any malice toward the party for killing the echelons of the priests, allowing him to properly instruct the fleshkin in accordance with the true faith.

The group was unconvinced by Longhorn’s purity of purpose, arguing that the proliferation of the Flesh would continue to harm the people of the disc. Longhorn attempted to stand against them in a battle but - even in the heart of his druidic grove - the party struck him down, ending the cult of Purity. Still, despite their best efforts, his body was able to make contact with the Flesh as he died, putting him into the cycle of reincarnation.

Rend, who had still been denied the worthy opponent she sought, broke off with the party here, leaping down from the heights of the canopy without so much as a word of farewell. Eva and Mary suspected that she might attempt to attack Fort Zeta and followed after her with the intention of talking her out of it. Eva was indeed able to redirect Rend but Mary argued that letting Rend loose to wreak havoc elsewhere was not a tenable solution. As such, the two attacked Rend in order to put a stop to her rampage.

Above, Eve asked AIDA if she thought she was shortsighted. AIDA was startled by the question but gave an honest answer that she did. Eve, who was still wrestling with some decision that she was unwilling to elaborate on took AIDA’s words to heart. On that subject, AIDA brought up the matter of Eva. Her recent actions were deeply questionable and Scrimblo joined in on the discussion about whether or not they should part ways with Eva or perhaps the Coalition forces as a whole. There were a mix of opinions but the three concluded that, although the Coalition could not be trusted, there was no real alternative to working with them, as they would lose too many resources.

Back on the ground, Eva drove her blade into Rend’s heart, killing its vessel. The sword itself remained intact and quickly moved to chose its new wielder. From the corpse of the predecessor, a braid detached itself to join the many emblems and trinkets at the sword’s tassels, making it clear that they had come from previous vessels rather than victims of the sword - though they were in a sense one and the same.

Both Eva and Mary fell under Rend’s sway and fought to gain possession of it. Eva emerged victorious in the struggle due to Mary’s weakened state but a number of red-cloaked rangers quickly took action, knocking Eva unconscious with a handful of sleep powder. Before they could move to contain Rend, the sword teleported away.

The rest of the party came to check on Eva and Mary, only to find them being tended to by the Red Cloaks. The rangers were not particularly interested in offering assistance to the party or the Coalition, but they told Eve when she asked that they came from a town named Cardia in the cursed woods to the far west.

After being contacted by AIDA, Hale brought the Javelin down to allow the party to board. While they traveled back to the fort, AIDA expanded the previous discussion about the trustworthiness of the Coalition to the other two members of the group. Mary, being anti-establishment by principle, immediately agreed that they should not be considered true allies. Eva likewise felt it was unwise to believe them to be faultless. She had a personal grievance with the Coalition, as they had ordered the death of her mentor for refusing to cooperate with them.

AIDA revealed that she had been programmed with information about magi of the Coalition due to her nature as a creation of the Subnetwork, with the offer to see if she knew anything of Eva’s mentor. Eva, in turn, admitted that her mentor was a member of the Subnetwork too, marking an unexpected connection between the two of them. As the other three in the party had no particular stake in the Coalition-Subnetwork conflict, AIDA was willing to explain that her creator was none other than the archmage Orsino - Jeremiah’s acquaintance who had trained Cyril and Anne Lupine. Unfortunately, however, she was not familiar with the twins so she could not offer insight into the possible actions of the survivor.

Upon their return to the fort and breaking the news that the cult of Purity had been destroyed, Commander Jomora furnished the party with military commendations, making them feel perhaps slightly conflicted about ending their association with the Coalition. Regardless, the party was soon off once more, this time heading for the Holte Estate.
