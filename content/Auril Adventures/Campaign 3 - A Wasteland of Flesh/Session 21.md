# Session 21

Yahg sent a messenger to inform Scrimblo that he was ready to perform the procedure that would render the Flesh inside him inert. AIDA insisted on going with him to ensure his safety during the operation. Upon their arrival, Yahg provided one final opportunity for Scrimblo to opt out - though he was quite confident in both the effectiveness and the lack of danger in what he had devised. Scrimblo gave his consent and Yahg made his final preparations.

Once he had finished, he asked Scrimblo to attempt to manipulate the Flesh. Scrimblo focused as he usually would to summon one of the many weapons in his arsenal… to no result. It appeared that Yahg had been successful. Scrimblo was stunned but glad, though he realized that he would be at a considerable disadvantage given that his old weapons were mundane.

While Eva and Eve were returning to Vitris, they caught sight of an approaching sandstorm. The rest of the party within the city saw it, too, and questioned a few of the locals about it. These sandstorms were a common enough occurrence during periods of conflict with the court of the Distant Prince. The people in Vitris thought little of the Prince’s blatant posturing but the party went out to examine the situation themselves.

In the oasis of the court blown in on the wild winds, the group found themselves meeting with Vamir. He was not immediately recognizable, as the pervasive magic of the court allowed those within its borders to approximate a living form, but when he informed them the Distant Prince had granted them entry, it was obvious who he was.

By royal decree, he had been appointed their guide to the city and he explained the social mores of the city. Due to the theoretically eternal existences of the residents of the court, a complex interconnected web of ancient schemes was their primary source of entertainment. Guests were not expected to understand the nuances of the political environment, of course, but politeness and observation of existing social strata was essential.

At AIDA and Eva’s request, Vamir ushered the party into the library. All its books were kept underground for preservation and like the city itself its catalog was segmented into tiers of access. The party had permission only to move through the lower levels of the city and were confined to the first subfloor of the library. Its contents were primarily personal records and family histories, though Eva was able to find some information about the founding of the court. It had been created around the time that Marina Swan covered the world in Ice with the stated goal of preserving the culture of the desert nomads. Despite its long history, only about thirty Princes had ruled the city.

AIDA bumped into a woman named Ruvyn Vimerios who carefully indicated that she was interested in ahem *circumventing* the system of tiers to access a book of heraldry kept in the palatial level of the library. AIDA, with Scrimblo in tow, accompanied her in the hope they might find something of interest themselves.

Eve, Eva, and Mary, meanwhile, asked Vamir where they might gain access to the higher tiers of the city. Vamir himself had lost enough in his absence prestige that he no longer had permission to enter the middle or palatial rungs. However, many of the residents of the city would gamble access in their games. The group made their way to one of the nearby gambling houses, conveniently ensuring the rest of the party’s activities in the library were outside Vamir’s view.

Eve made a beeline to the small area set up for arm-wrestling where she met a man named Jastira. He was gregarious and more than willing to play against Eve. He emerged victorious in their contest but offered Eve - and the rest of the trio - the opportunity for a rematch in a game of liar’s dice. Jastira put up access to the palatial district in the form of invitations to the next public appearance of the Distant Prince as his ante while Eve and Eva offered the meteor steel breastplate and five years of her work, respectively, on their end.

Meanwhile, in the depths in the library, Scrimblo and AIDA found a few more books of interest. One of them, focused on the Flesh, theorized that the preservation of the discs was the result of the intervention of the druid of the Hand of Mystral named Achuak Darastrix. It also indicated that the Marrow Woods had been the last refuge of the Flesh on Zeta until Its recent incursion.

AIDA also managed to pick out a particularly useful record of holdings in the treasury of the Distant Prince that placed the diamond the party was searching for in the head of the sphinx that served as the base of the city. It originated from one of the rifts to the Plane of Fire once inside a now-sunken volcano much like the one near Agranic.

She was unable to find information about the storm worshipped by the kobolds in the west but she found that it was contactable using sending. This, in AIDA’s opinion, removed it as a possible replacement for the angel trapped in the Holte Estate.

Back in the gambling house, Eve emerged victorious in the game of liar’s dice, earning the party a legitimate means to progress further into the city.
