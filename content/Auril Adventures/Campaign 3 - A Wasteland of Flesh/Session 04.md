# Session 4

Since the engineers would require time to modify their prototype in line with Eva's suggestions, the adventurers spent the rest of the day in Scrimblo. The people were friendly and the atmosphere was quite different from the militarized Fort Zeta so the party took the opportunity to relax.

The engineers, however, did not sleep a wink, as became obvious when an exhausted junior engineer knocked on the door of Scrimblo's apartment a few hours after dawn. The submersible tank was complete and ready to deploy as soon as the adventurers were.

After a quick meal, the party was briefed on the operation of the vehicle. Despite the complex nature of its machinery, it was simple enough to operate that any one of the group could do so. The cabin would only fit four passengers comfortably but the five of them were able to pile in with a minimum of elbowing.

As they passed through the first condemned level, Constanze knocked against one of the windows, clearly intending to continue yesterday's conversation. She was summarily ignored.

It was a testament to the skill of Scrimblo's engineers that, even with the combined pressure of the blood and the depth of the underground, the exterior of the tank held firm. In contrast to the decay seen above, this level of Scrimblo remained mostly intact. Most of the doors of the apartments had been flung open and their contents flooded but a few units had been closed and preserved. A muffled grinding sound could be heard to the north.

The party stopped at the first sealed unit, the first in the eastern block of housing, and confirmed that they would be able to create a seal between the door of the apartment and the side of the tank, allowing them to venture inside. The particular unit was unremarkable aside from a finely woven rug hung at the back of the main hallway. It had a strange allure that Eva and AIDA concluded was magical. A closer inspection revealed that it had been imbued with a protection from heat that could be conferred to a single person. Since AIDA did not need to breathe and could, in combination with the enchantment, walk outside the tank, she was the one to take its blessing.

Along their path north, the party passed a number of strange sights. A number of semitransparent sacs appeared to be in the process of gestating new creatures of the Flesh and one fully formed creature was attempting to break into one of the sealed apartment units. They opted to ignore both for now in favour of dealing with the thing to the north.

Coiled around the remnants of the greenhouse was a large snake-like creature that was attempting to crush the structure. It quickly spotted the tank and tried to do the same to it but due to its lethargic speed the party was able to kill it while sustaining only minor damage to the tank. Once it was dead, the immediate area noticeably decreased in temperature, suggesting that the creature was the source of the boiling temperatures.

The group turned their attention to clearing out the rest of the infestation of Flesh, which took relatively little time. With each area declared clear, they opened the sealed rooms to search for anything that might be returned to evacuees on the upper levels. They retrieved two corpses, an enchanted oil painting, and a sheaf of research notes from a woman who had been trapped in the flooding. She had been an amateur chemist and was able to determine that coagulating the blood - if done in sufficient qualities - would allow Scrimblo to neutralize the blood and eventually reclaim this level. Mary figured the conclusion was theoretically reasonable and experiments around the apartment confirmed it functioned on samples. Scaling up the method would be left to Scrimblo's engineers.

All that remained was the final level of submerged housing. The party doubted that the tank would be able to survive the digestive acid that had filled that level and they decided to return to the occupied levels. A slightly more well-rested group of engineers awaited their return and eagerly began discussions of both the coagulation agent and some type of armour for the tank. Eva initially suggested a mucous membrane but the idea was dismissed for being both too difficult to source and too gross to implement.

Gold, on the other hand, was a material that the adventurers had on hand and could be fashioned into a thin yet protective coating over the tank. While the engineers worked to melt and refashion their savings, they asked the group to examine the liquid outtake pipes on the surface. There was an outline of a plan to deal with the acid by neutralizing it that would require pumping the resulting liquid out through the drainage system and a few engineers were concerned that it might be blocked by flesh.

The party found they were not the only ones searching for the outtake when another group of Purity cultists ambled up to them. It was evident from the brief discussion that passed between them that the cultists were searching for a means to enter Scrimblo. The adventurers didn't give them the opportunity to explain any further and despite fierce resistance they were able to kill the cultists, preventing them from returning to their mysterious leader with information on Scrimblo's location and defenses.
