# Session 14

Not long after Eve and Mary returned to the rest of their companions, AIDA received a message from the surviving Lupine twin. It was a terse command code and instructions to separate herself from the group to await transportation in the next five minutes. Constructing a quick plan, AIDA informed the party of her intention to take Lupine up on the offer, knowing that she could escape with magic if need be.

An elemental bearing a box came to collect AIDA, taking her to what appeared to be a basement. Anne Lupine, who had sustained several injuries from the crash that killed Cyril, had evidently not remained idle. She and a number of dissidents in Revat had banded together with the intent of removing Holte from power. Lupine was not particularly interested in avenging the people whom Bertram had drained of blood, but removing him as an obstacle. According to rumours, a trove of magic and weaponry was hidden away on the disc and her own research indicated that Holte had possession of it.

AIDA was able to give Lupine the impression that she was willing to aid her and requested permission to return to the group in order to infiltrate the castle. Anne agreed and sent her back in time for dinner.

The trek to the Holte estate was spent debating the likelihood of Lupine’s information being correct. Without many details the party was unable to come to a conclusion, but they remained cautious as they reached the estate. Many of the people displaced from Strabor had been moved to the estate for housing and as such the party arrived in a whirl of activity. Even so, Bertram met them in the foyer and provided them with a short tour. The adventurers’ accommodations for the night could be found on the third floor.

The following dinner was lavish, though Bertram himself of course did not partake. As politely as they could, the party attempted to probe the matter of the barrier around the estate again without success. Sensing that they were unlikely to get anywhere with talk alone, Eve, Eva, and Mary distracted Bertram in the billiards room once the meal was finished, allowing AIDA and Scrimblo to sneak off to explore.

While Bertram absolutely destroyed the party at pool, he made a request of them. The members of his family who had turned away from principle had taken up residence in a crypt. If the party was able to eliminate them, it would be a lasting solution to the incursions that had resulted in Strabor’s destruction. Seeing no reason not to, they accepted.

Meanwhile, AIDA found that the higher she climbed in the castle, the worse her symptoms of discomfort grew. Scrimblo did his best to support her. Using a ferret that made its home in the estate’s walls, AIDA was able to confirm that there was a fifth floor blocked off by a locked door. In the interest of discretion, AIDA called for Eva’s help. She was able to pick the lock without much issue.

The path up to the fifth floor was heavily warded and inscribed with various glyphs that clearly held traps. It would be impractical to dispel all of them, so the trio opted to physically avoid them as best they could. When they reached the single room of the fifth floor, they learned the nature of Bertram Holte’s secret.

A small sun was imprisoned in this chamber. It was immediately apparent that it was the source of AIDA’s difficulties, as she collapsed the moment the door was opened and there were no barriers between them. Communing with the divine being, AIDA learned that the sun was being used to fuel not only the barrier but most of the technology around the estate’s grounds. AIDA’s condition rapidly deteriorated to the point that Eva and Scrimblo removed her from the presence of the sun, preventing any further questioning of it.

While they navigated back to the third floor, the Lord of Flowers informed AIDA that the sun was the servant of the solar deity that the Holtes destroyed upon their rise to power. As soon as the party retired for the night, they exchanged what information they had learned. AIDA, in particular, was deeply troubled by all this, but she wanted to speak with Bertram before making any decisions.

Late in the night, Mary snuck out of the room, followed by Eve. Again Mary made her argument that they should kill Holte. After all, during their expedition over the ice where people inflicted suffering, they didn’t give them the opportunity to explain themselves - they struck them down. Eve, who found herself in turmoil both because of her complicated feelings about Mary and the fact that eliminating Holte might lead to the deaths of all the innocent people on his lands, eventually agreed to give her support to Mary when she made her case to the party. However, she emphasized that they needed everyone’s support for the plan, if only from the practical perspective that the two of them could not kill a vampire lord.

At first light, the party headed out to speak with Bertram, who was passing muster on his assembled troops. Bertram listened to their findings silently, seemingly unmoved. With his usual politeness, he apologized for lying to them about the source of his powers but was not interested in hearing the party’s arguments. Even hearing that the sun was subject to unimaginable suffering did not sway him at all, as he was too committed to protecting his subjects to care. Additionally, he claimed that as its god was gone, its forced servitude to the Holtes was the only thing keeping it alive.

AIDA, recalling that she had seen the use of the sun for generations, asked unobtrusively what it had been used for before the incursion of the Flesh. Bertram did not even bother trying to address her question, instead deflecting back to the fact that it was needed now. Eve asked him if he would consider another option if the party was able to find one for him but Bertram claimed that there were reasons why things had to stay as they were. He quickly grew tired of the group’s accusations and dismissed them to return to his task.

Mary quickly made her suggestion that they simply remove him from the picture. In general, the party was not opposed to this idea but they were concerned about the fate of the common people if he was killed before finding an alternative to the sun. AIDA sought possible suggestions from her god, though if there was nothing they could do, she was also willing to take the place of the sun and power the barrier herself. Everyone else in the group vehemently objected to the mere idea of doing so, but unless they came up with a solution, they would have no other choice.
