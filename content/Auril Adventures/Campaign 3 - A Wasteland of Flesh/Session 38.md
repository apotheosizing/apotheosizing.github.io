# Session 38

Within the maw of the beast sprawled a strange landscape of chrome and wires unlike anything the party had seen on the disc. The esophageal entry hall led into a room where group of small constructs were performing repairs on pylons that had been broken in the party's battle with the dragon. These drones were not much of a threat to the group but AIDA spotted a larger construct among the overhead wiring and scaffolding that seemed more dangerous. Indeed, in the ensuing battle, the construct shocked Mary into a paralyzed state and fled with her in its grasp. Fortunately, she was able to shake off the effect and escape before it reached its lair.

The party proceeded through a door to the southwest into a room where much of the flooring had collapsed into the innards of the vault. All that remained was a mechanism that projected images on the western wall of the room. The series began with a simple sling labeled "iteration zero" and was refined thousands of times until it reached its most recent state: a large-scale artillery weapon that generated lightning rather than using ammunition.

Three prototypes of that design were housed in this room and, at a word from what could only be the angel of Gond housed in the vault, they were activated to repel the intruders. Though powerful, these cannons were hamstrung by the need to recharge, which the party exploited to their advantage.

After moving through a furnace room where various metals were smelted into useable material for the construction of additions and new inventions for the vault and the destroyed storm generation system, they party came upon a small alcove where an altar to Gond had been constructed. AIDA placed a gold coin into a slot on the altar and received in return a tiny golden cog bearing a fragment of Gond's grace. Eve, thinking of Kijenor, asked AIDA to press another cog, which she obliged.

To the north lay a spherical chamber where the angel of Gond awaited. It examined the strange creatures that had carved their way into the vault with some confusion and in the ensuing silence it became clear that it had been many centuries since it had occasion to speak at all. When it did speak, the angel asked the party why their iteration had been interrupted. Carefully, AIDA explained that Nimbus decided that the vault might be turned to better purposes. It was confused, and even more so when AIDA indicated that it might return to Gond's side since its mission was completed.

As it was increasingly apparent that they would not be able to explain the concept of a finished task to a celestial made to iterate endlessly on a base design, AIDA attempted to banish it back to the god's realm to no avail. In response the angel attacked - and the retrieval construct took this opportunity to ambush the party from behind. The party was able to dispatch both in short order before contacting Nimbus to let them know that the vault's internal defences had been neutralized. They were pleased with the party's efficiency and, in exchange, indicated that they would use their powers to repair the vault for the Coalition's use in their final assault on the Flesh.

With another ally gained for their cause, the party turned their attention to the vanished city of Cyretta of which AIDA had read in Scrimblo (town)'s archives...
