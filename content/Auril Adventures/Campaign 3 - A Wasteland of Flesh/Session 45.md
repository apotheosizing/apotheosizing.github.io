# Session 45

Unexpectedly, the next room contained a protruding bone on which had been scrimshawed a pictorial narrative of the rise of the house of Mann. Atop the bone was a small talisman that Eve only barely glimpsed. She boosted Scrimblo to a height with it and he was able to retrieve it. It depicted a skull with two black flames in its eyes held in the grasp of a skeletal hand.

As the room appeared to be uninhabited, the party set down to rest for a time, during which they learned that the talisman was a magical item. Malady lamented that he could not give them a little light entertainment in the form of music but, fortunately for them all, Eve had an instrument she could lend him.

On their way out, Scrimblo made an effort to carve off some of the more picturesque images on the bone, thinking that he might be able to sell them to an art collector. However, gouging into the bone caused the many figures carved into it to spring to life and attack. Fighting them off was no difficulty for the refreshed party but the potential art pieces were sadly lost.

Further south, the party came into a room separated by a curtain of dark slime that gave off a distinctly caustic smell. Eve was able to pass through it thanks to absorb elements and discover the source of the slime: a strange organ that produced the trap. She disabled it by destroying the organ, allowing the others to pass through. They continued to another small, empty chamber. At its end was a mouth that did not speak when addressed, only forming expressions. Setting foot in the room prompted it to open at last and the party found that within, rather than a tongue, was a rough humanoid form that lolled toward them.

Eve, still wondering whether there was any part of the mountain that had escaped Jebediah's control, attempted to speak with it to no effect. Jebediah's voice came from its mouth and told her definitively that his control over the Flesh was absolute. The party cut out the tongue before taking a door to the north. At first glance, it seemed to be an exact replica of the entrance hall but closer examination revealed that a number of the floor tiles were sunk an inch lower than the rest, forming a path to a door on the other side.

There, the party found a little breathing room - literally. Numerous alveoli hung in the room and its walls shifted minutely with each breath. It attempted to expel the irritants by pushing them out into an adjacent room. Pushing past it could likely be accomplished but it seemed this was the end of this branch of the mountain. On their way back to the entrance, the adventurers came into contact with a goat. It seemed in all aspects to be a normal animal until Eve gave it a pat on the head and found her hand stuck there. The goat then revealed itself to be a mimic, forcing the party to strike it down in order to continue.

The western side of the mountain remained unexplored so it was there that the party went. Through the next door the party encountered a Constanze. She had interfaced her own nerves and neurons with an organ of the mountain, apparently seeking to wrest control of the Flesh from Jebediah. She greeted the party brightly and said that she would take care of matters here, encouraging them to go to the seat of Jebediah's power - the titan's brain - and destroy it. 

Dutifully, they proceeded onward to an unpleasant chamber filled with gnashing teeth. Three doors led in varying directions, south, north, and west. More or less randomly, the party chose the north door which led them through a winding hallway to a room that held a rib cage enclosing a knife. Eve recognized it as a match for the blade Mary had used to kill Jebediah beneath the original manor and figured that it may aid them in doing so again in the present. Using windblade, she cut through the bones to retrieve the knife, only narrowly avoiding a circle of protective teeth that tried to sever the offending hand.

Back in the enamelled room, the party took the west door. Two familiar faces and a waxen image of the same were in the midst of an argument that was promptly settled by the party's appearnace. Gildan, Valanthe, and the Black Candle rounded on the party without another word, eager to complete the task that had led them to this wretched place. Both Gildan and Valanthe were skilled in their craft and that alone would be enough to give the party pause but the antimagic field created by the eponymous candle the assassin wore made the ensuing battle much more complicated.

Luckily for the duo, the antimagic field prevented Valanthe from unleashing the worst of her magic on them, allowing them to focus first on Gildan. Eve tried to circumvent the field by circling around through the north door to ambush Valanthe while Scrimblo finished knocking out Gildan. The Black Candle followed her, causing what would have been a mage's duel to devolve into two people beating each other with wooden staves.

In the end, however, the party emerged victorious. Valanthe was killed in her fight with Eve and the Candle dissipated into wax. Since the party bore them no ill will, Scrimblo and Eve each hoisted one of the other two onto their backs and took them with, confident that they would be able to revive Valanthe later.

The next several rooms had been cleared of whatever obstacles Jebediah had concocted by their would-be murderers, which allowed the party a reprieve from fighting until they came upon a room filled with partially dissolved worms. This did not seem to be the work of their pursuers and shortly the discovery of a damaged trenchcoat among the bodies made the situation clear.

While the party puzzled out how Lou had ended up in the path of the mountain, the creature that had attacked them made its move. An ooze dropped down from the ceiling, using the element of surprise to get a short-lived leg up in the battle before the party rallied and destroyed it.

In the adjacent room, the party found an injured Lou. While Eve healed them, they explained that they had ranged widely from Fort Zeta in the weeks since the party had last seen them; their presence near the mountain was simply an unfortunate confluence. This was ultimately to the party's benefit, however, as they learned Lou had instructed one of their parasites to make a tunnel out of the mountain. It was unfinished but would serve as a safe place to rest before they made their final push to the mountain's brain. Gratefully, they set down for the night, readying themselves for what they hoped would be their last encounter with Jebediah Mann.
