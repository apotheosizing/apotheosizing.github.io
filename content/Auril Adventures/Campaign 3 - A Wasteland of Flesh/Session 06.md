# Session 6

While the party fought off the encroaching creatures, Hale set about rigging up the replacement balloon. Although the rest of the company was occupied with the battle, the enchantment of the Lord of Flowers lingered on the ship and its livingwood aided Hale in his work.

Once the ship was prepared, the adventurers boarded the ship. From their elevated position, they finished off the monsters before taking to the skies. As they flew back to Fort Zeta, AIDA attempted to scry on the Flesh. Rather than seeing the heart of the god, she saw countless places across the disc: a rising mountain of flesh, a populated town, a massive eyeball staring up at the sky, a horned skeleton awash in slime, fields of muscle fed upon by bloated creatures.

As was becoming customary, a few members of the party went to visit the priest of Purity. Eva questioned him about the beliefs of his congregation. Unlike the majority of the people of Eoril, the cultists of Purity believed that the Flesh originated from a cursed forest in the west. She further questioned him about his life before his encounter with the Flesh but he had no real interest in recalling the person he used to be.

The party’s next destination was the farmland to the north. Given its proximity to the fort, it was important to gather intelligence about who and what could be found there. As they approached the little farm, a little cottage was visible, as well as a figure digging a new furrow into the ground. This person introduced themselves to the party as Lousy Lou.

Despite being completely covered from head to toe, they were more than willing to speak to the curious adventurers. Their farm was dedicated to cultivating parasites, several of which lived inside their body. These creatures fed on the Flesh and were thus considered unclean by the cult of Purity. As they shared a common enemy, Lou were happy to form a business relationship with the party.

The fact that the parasites consumed Flesh made AIDA wonder about the possibility of using them to treat Scrimblo’s infection. She and Eve concluded that it was possible that such a method would work but given that it was untested, there were a number of possible dangers. Eva and AIDA were able to conclude that the parasites could be controlled and induced to remove themselves from hosts by a direct trial of one of the parasites on Eva.

In exchange for a free sample, Lou requested that the party assist in calling up a large specimen from beneath the earth. The group was able to entice and subdue the parasite’s host - a large worm - with ease. It left behind a tunnel that led into the earth that intrigued Lou and they asked the party to investigate it. Having no reason to refuse, they headed in.

A sticky slime covered the walls of the tunnel, slowing the party’s exploration. Strange pillars jutted out of the earth, filled with worm-fish with legs that attempted to bite any who came close. A number of branching tunnels led out from the central one, perhaps leading to burrows or other locations that would hold something of interest.

At random, the party headed along a tunnel to the northwest. A large pearl, filmed over by the slime, sat at the back of the short passage. AIDA went to retrieve it but when it was removed from its resting place, the Flesh around it reacted, attempting to trap the intruders inside some kind of esophageal chamber. Fortunately, Eve was able to wrench open one of the sphincters long enough to allow AIDA to escape before any digestive fluid or mucous could trap her inside. The effort turned out to be well-worth it, as the pearl held some useful magical power.
