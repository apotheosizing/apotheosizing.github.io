# Session 46

Up a cavity that was more throat than spinal column, the party crawled into the titan's cranium. An expectant Jebediah welcomed them to the final seat of his power on Auril before moving to eliminate the last obstacle to his conquest that they represented.

In the fighting Malady was revealed to be nothing more than a doppelganger created by Jebediah's influence over the mountain and he turned against the party but his lack of equipment made him a minimal threat.

Jebediah himself, however, was as formidable as he had ever been, managing to kill Eve with a mere word, though AIDA counteracted him quickly enough that this did not hinder the party. Unlike the simulacrum they had met outside the mountain the true Jebediah Mann was crowned by a grotesque halo of Flesh that afforded him complete control over their surroundings and extended the protection of the Flesh to him in addition to his own considerable defences.

Nevertheless, the party had the advantage of numbers and inevitably Jebediah fell. The halo was pulled from his head as his dying form was transformed into a monstrous creature of the Flesh. This being shed Jebediah's reason for sheer offensive power and constitution. To make matters worse a hand clawed through the muscle tissue of the "floor" and a Constanze appeared, stating her intent to finish off her descendant herself. The party had no intention of letting her accomplish whatever goal she had in mind for the mountain and fortunately the Fleshy Jebediah was no match for Scrimblo. Using the replica dagger she had obtained in the bowels of the titan Eve struck the final blow.

As the creature breathed its last, another intruder made itself known: the Seer. It was in a state of frenzy only exacerbated by the sight of the halo of Flesh. Both it and Constanze lunged for the halo as the titan began the process of dissolution, shaking the whole structure, and Constanze's was the hand that reached it first. With his quick reflexes Scrimblo wrested it from her grasp and placed it into the portable hole that he'd taken from Gildan.

Scrimblo appealed to the party's brief alliance with the Seer, saying that Constanze was their shared enemy. The Seer agreed, killing the Constanze without a moment's hesitation using the same word Jebediah had invoked to kill Eve. It then turned back to Scrimblo.

Mary, with her usual leap-before-you-look attitude, leapt into the portable hole to deal with the root of the problem. Another quake from the titan reminded them all of the immediate danger and Eve convinced it to take Scrimblo outside the titan so that they could come to an agreement in safety. The Seer agreed and promptly pulled Scrimblo through the Flesh, leaving AIDA and Eve to collect Lou and depart themselves.

They arrived to the Seer demanding the halo from Scrimblo, claiming that it was its rightful possession. The party was still of two minds regarding the Seer and thus willing to seek a compromise with it. So began the negotiations.

Meanwhile, within the portable hole Mary took hold of the halo and ate it. She then found herself in an aged smoking room with Jebediah Mann. He was at the age he had been when the party first met him, reclining casually on one of the couches. He asked her what her interest in the halo was. Mary said that she simply didn't want anyone to have it. Jebediah laughed, saying that was the mindset of a toddler but one he understood nonetheless. He proposed that they make a deal, as the other potential outcome was one or the other destroying them both.

He was willing to relinquish the halo to her peaceably in exchange for the allowance of his soul to simply take up residence in some of the many organisms that made up Mary. She declined, knowing very well how dangerous Jebediah could be even in such a weakened state. Jebediah, a little strained now, reminded her that the alternative was their deaths. Mary shrugged and said that she had no great attachment to living. It seemed her continued existence had only brought pain to others, no matter what she did.

Jebediah - the great survivor - could not possibly understand this mindset. Like Mary he had been the source of great suffering in the world but unlike her he did not regret a moment of it. Under the assumption that this meant his will was the greater, he made a final assault on Mary's mental defences to gain control of her. He was wrong.

Outside the portable hole, the constituent parts of the titan were decomposing at a rate that sent limbs crashing to the earth mere minutes after the party's escape. Soon enough there would be nothing left of the titan that had dominated Aetra's horizon for years. The Seer insisted on seeing the halo and Scrimblo obliged, inverting the portable hole to reveal its contents. The corpses of all the parasites that had formed Mary fell out of the box with Rend, with no sign of the halo.

Rend, at Mary's behest, passed along her last words to Eve. She thanked Eve for her friendship and impressed upon her that, though she knew Eve had her doubts over the years on the advisedness of extending Mary's life given what she had made of it, it hadn't been a mistake. She offered her apologies for her many misdeeds but said that she'd at least made the last one count.

The Seer, in an incoherent fury over the lost of the body it had been seeking, moved as though to strike at Mary's remains but Eve intervened, shattering it into ice with a spell. Scrimblo took custody of Rend and AIDA transported the surviving members of the party and their two failed assassins to the consecrated fort in the God's Grave Mountains.

In all the chaos of the last several days, all three had forgotten that they had invited the people of Cyretta to relocate to the area, so they were surprised to find it partially destroyed by the sudden arrival of a dozen buildings from the Astral Plane. While AIDA and Eve prepared a gravesite for Mary, Scrimblo woke Gildan. He thought he might be able to talk Gildan into aiding them in their work of destroying the Flesh but Gildan's price was the deed to his bar which Scrimblo had sold. He summarily knocked Gildan unconscious again, deciding that he was a problem for tommorow.

After a proper rest, AIDA revived Valanthe - who took her casting focus back from Scrimblo and left with Gildan in tow as soon as she was conscious - and set in a headstone for Mary. She asked Eve if there were any words she would like set in as an epitaph but Eve, still shaken by the unexpected end of one of her longest relationships, couldn't answer her.

In spite of their recent loss, the party knew that Vitris remained in peril so they had no time to mourn. AIDA teleported them to Fort Zeta to requisition the airship and the last of the Coalition's reinforcements for their journey there.

After a few days travel, the Javelin landed in Vitris in a familiar state of siege. The city had put up a barrier to keep out the whirling sandstorm that marked the approach of the Prince's City and all the people out of doors were stockpiling supplies or otherwise working to aid in the city's defence. The party quickly joined in.

AIDA secured a supply of artificial diamonds to assist in reviving the fallen from the glasssmiths, though it would require tradeoffs in other areas of preparation as the labour and resources were redirected. She also summoned Sepharial and her celestial corps who were more than willing to help for the right price. Scrimblo rallied a number of additional recruits and ensured they would have proper meals in the fray. Eve set up several mirages and traps across the prospective field of engagement to provide field control, as well as aiding AIDA in lifting some of the worst of the poor weather brought by the sandstorm. But even as they worked to bolster Vitris' forces, the Prince's City was approaching...
