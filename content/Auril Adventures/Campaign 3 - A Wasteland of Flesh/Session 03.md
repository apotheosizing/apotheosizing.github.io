# Session 3

Hidden within the material of the nest were a few items of note: a handful of potions and a chestpiece forged from an unfamilar metal. While they distributed these, the party debated their next move. Eve could enable them to travel by air once more that day and eventually the group decided it would be best spent taking them to Scrimblo to open communications with the only known large settlement in the vicinity.

As they sped overland, they were surprised to find no buildings stood where Scrimblo should be. Scrimblo (the person) explained that the reason the town had remained safe was that it was entirely underground and protected from intruders by various false entrances. Fortunately, Scrimblo knew the correct way inside.

The cramped tunnel led to a door guarded by a man named Dooglass. Any instinct toward suspicion was allayed by the presence of Scrimblo in the party’s ranks and they were invited inside in short order. By necessity, the town descended vertically into the earth rather than sprawling out as a traditional settlement did. The top floor, being closest to the dangers above, was occupied only by the guard and the mayor’s office.

Scrimblo’s mayor was pleasantly surprised by the party’s offer of support from Fort Zeta and sought the party’s aid with a problem that had come to a head of late. Approximately a year ago, flooding had made the lower levels of Scrimblo uninhabitable. If the flooding had been mundane, they would have been able to pump out the water and work on reconstruction but it had been boiling blood and digestive fluid that had welled up from the earth. A number of containment measures had been put in place but a more permanent solution was required.

As far as the town’s efforts were concerned, a group of engineers had been working on creating a vehicle to traverse the muck in the hope that they could reach and seal the incursion point with little success. Eva, however, was confident she would be able to assist them.

AIDA reported back to Felicity on Scrimblo (the town)’s status and received her permission to remain there for a time. Worryingly, she felt a pervasive sense that someone was listening in on her during this communication, prompting her to keep it brief. Given that there were reports of strange creatures in the lower levels, the party opted to spent the night at Scrimblo’s home before venturing below.

After a rest, the party descended through the quarantine zone. On this uppermost level, a thick, rising gas had killed most of the plant life but the structures remained intact, indicating that it was toxic rather than corrosive. As they explored, they heard a voice that seemed to emanate from all around them, claiming that they were intruders.

Calling out prompted the gases to coalesce into the vague form of a person - the woman whom the members of the Icebreaker expedition had fought at Hub Theta. She insisted that she was well within her rights to subsume the town of Scrimblo, as it had been carved into the Flesh by greedy hands. She also showed an interest in Scrimblo (the person) as a perfect example of how things should be. AIDA, disliking this immensely and certain that this was the person who had been eavesdropping on her message to Felicity, banished the woman, allowing the party to escape down to the flooded levels.

AIDA and Eva took a number of samples from the pooling blood, establishing in doing so that removing the blood caused it to cool. This suggested that something below the surface was actively heating it and would need to be neutralized. Unfortunately, without a safe means of diving, they could not proceed any further for the time being. Nevertheless, the party had a better idea of what was going on and would be able to apply that knowledge going forward. On their return jour

Back on the habitable levels of Scrimblo, Eva consulted with the engineers and suggested a possible design to protect the internal mechanisms of the craft from harm, drawing inspiration from animals that lived in extreme conditions. AIDA, too, made herself useful by enriching the town's hydroponic gardens and alleviating some of the supply problems caused by the influx of refugees with the spread of the Flesh.
