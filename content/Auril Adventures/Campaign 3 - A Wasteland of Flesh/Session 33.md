# Session 33

The distance the party was able to cover in a day as the wind blows was just short of Cardia, by in the morning, they required only an hour of additional travel to reach the city. The city was constructed mainly out of bone and leather but for all its unorthodox appearance its people seemed lively and content. An old hunting lodge was the largest building in the city and thus the party's first destination.

A guard at the door directed the adventurers to speak with the huntmaster within. He was a gregarious old aarakocra named Ukra and he was more than willing to share the knowledge of the Red Rangers with the group. In the abridged history of Cardia, the Marrow Woods had been filled with Flesh for as long as people had lived there. It was, as the party had supposed, the inception point of the incursion of the Flesh across the disc, but the rangers were unable to warn the cities of Eoril in time to mount a defence.

The party asked about the location of the mountain they had seen in Constanze's memories but, aside from a reference to a mountain that had slowly been moving toward the city for years, Ukra didn't have that information to hand. However, he would soon have the time to dig through the records as he was to retire in a few days. In the meantime, he offered to provide a tour of the city and extended Cardia's hospitality to the party while they waited for the appointment of the new huntmaster.

Oldtown held much of the commerical aspects of the city, including a proliferation of poisoners. The nearby district of Haven was the primary landing place of the refugees from the incursion. As Ukra led them through, AIDA spotted a Coalition flag in the window of one of the inns. The party headed in to investigate and learned that a man named Erland was staying there. He was shocked to hear that forces from the Coalition had come to see him and explained his situation without much further prompting. He was one of the few survivors from the previous commander of Fort Zeta's ill-fated push into the disc who had been too injured in the fighting to return to the fort. Eve was able to heal his leg and the party promised to bring him back to the fort when they departed Cardia.

Ukra then took the party to the small handful of heavily-guarded greenhouses that provided all of the city's non-meat food. As she had for Scrimblo (town), AIDA offered to enrich the soil there to increase their harvest for the following year. Ukra gratefully accepted.

Surprisingly, a number of Flesh cultists had come to Cardia after the formal dissolution of the cult but they gave the party a wide berth. Lastly, there was the Tannery, which was a splinter faction of people who had only recently rejoined the city. To pass the time, the party visited a few points of interest. Mary, of course, went to the poisoners and attempted to have the last sample of blood she had taken from the Shackled Star made into a poison. Eve, meanwhile, visited the Tanners, where she observed their animosity toward the Flesh cultists over their view of the Flesh. For the Tanners, the Flesh that had resulted from the incursion was unnatural. She also invited herself and the party along on a hunt the following day.

AIDA was working on her ritual for the greenhouses when she realized that she had not seen the Seer since their arrival in the city. To avoid interrupting her spellwork, she asked Scrimblo to search for it on her behalf. He was able to locate it in one of the city's open-air markets, having a conversation with Constanze.

When confronted, it told Scrimblo that they were simply speaking about recent events. Much to Scrimblo's discomfort, Constanze invited him to join them for some lunch. She told him that she liked Cardia best of all cities on the disc, as it was a shining example of what could be if people embraced the presence of the Flesh. In fact, she claimed that she had no designs on the city - she simply lived here. After she bid them adieu, Scrimblo asked the Seer why it had talked with her. The Seer said that this Constanze had approached it first but that she had been pleasant enough.

Out on the hunt with the Tanners the next day, the party learned that the various contenders for the position of huntmaster were out pursuing their own targets. Their leader, Volkmarr, also mentioned sightings of a dryad that piqued the party's interest. After the hunt was over they sought out the man who had seen the dryad, Eleazar Morgan. He was able to point the adventurers toward the tree where the dryad had been seen.

The "tree" was in truth another twisted growth of the Flesh into which the dryad had fled after the destruction of the tree from which she had originated. Eve offered to plant a tree for her in the greenhouses using the fruit produced by her staff and the dryad was happy to accept. She was so delighted that she pulled Eve into her tree to thank her properly.

AIDA and Mary followed in after her and all three saw firsthand the depth of the damage done to the dryad by being forced to inhabit such a place. Open sores and peeling skin covered both the body of the tree and the dryad herself and her condition was actively worsening the longer she remained in the tree. However, careful prompting from the party revealed that the dryad was frightened of leaving, even for a newly-grown tree. AIDA and Eve were able to convince her to allow the use of divine intervention to safely place her within the new tree.

By dawn the next day, the hunt would be over, freeing Ukra from his responsibilities. With no other matters to take care of in the city, the party headed to bed. People had already begun to flock to the lodge to welcome back the victorious hunters by the time the party arrived. The last of the five contenders arrived later than the others and so the people of Cardia were anxious to get on with the naming of the new huntmaster. Volkmarr was to give a short speech before Ukra appeared to choose his successor but as his speech grew longer and longer it became apparent that something was wrong. First Volkmarr and then the party were called to the back rooms of the lodge to find a grisly sight: the corpse of Ukra Screechwind.
