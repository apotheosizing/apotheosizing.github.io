# Session 35

The moment that it was light enough for travel, Daphne and Ukra woke the party for their foray into the Marrow Woods. As they made their way to the forest, the hunters gave the party an idea of what to expect. Generally, the people of Cardia spent years training and acclimating themselves to the wood before seeking out the Heart. Those whom it judged as unworthy were either misled or chased away by the creatures of the forest. Since they didn't have the luxury of several years, the party was going to have to take their chances.

As they passed the western edge of the city, Volkmarr gave a quick warning to the group. The small contingent of cultists of the Flesh had left Cardia seemingly overnight and the timing of their departure was suspect. The party thanked promised to keep an eye out for them.

Daphne estimated that the journey to the Heart would take two to three days. Fortunately, they did not need to be wary of attacks from the Purity cultists for all three days, as they encountered two priests and the ritually amalgamated remains of the rest of the cult by afternoon. These rituals were no longer a strange sight for the party but this particular use of it appeared different than the others, as the Flesh of the Marrow Woods was not so willing to be manipulated by these intruders.

It quickly became apparent that the cultists' departure had been at Constanze's direction, given that one of the priests did a terrible job of pretending that they had no idea who she was. Once the cultists and their creation had been slain, Daphne asked who, exactly, Constanze was. The party's response was not exactly comforting. Still, they continued deeper into the wood.

By the end of the following day, the travellers had reached the carved slab of rock that marked the beginning of the path to the Heart. From here, the pace of travel was forced to slow, making the attention of the forest on the party ever more noticeable, but they were still taken by surprise when Scrimblo and Mary were entangled by the flesh of the forest. It addressed each of them in turn, identifying them as potential threats to itself.

Scrimblo, as a vessel of the Flesh, was the most potent of dangers to it. The flesh of the Heart knew very well the rapacious expansion of what it called the New Flesh and had resisted it at every turn. Carefully, Scrimblo explained that the Flesh within him was contained and that he had no intention of letting it loose in the Marrow Wood. The Heart accepted this answer with the stipulation that he come to see and understand the flesh as it should be.

Mary was a more surprising objection. It believed that the many parasites that she carried might seek to make their home in it. Mary said that there was no such risk as the parasites were firmly attached to her. The Heart was puzzled by this response, as it would more rightly say that the parasites were collectively what had Mary herself, and agreed to let her proceed so that she could more properly understand her existence.

When the party was released, Ukra expressed considerable surprise that the flesh had spoken aloud. In all his years as huntsmaster he had never experienced such a thing. Despite his earlier plans to bring the party to the Heart, it was clear that Ukra was beginning to have misgivings about the wisdom of that. All these extraordinary events felt portentous.

Not long after the Heart had declared their safe passage, the party reached the Heart of the forest. A massive old growth tree had grown to match its fellows out of a deep sinkhole, fueled by the creatures of the flesh around it. So intrinsic was this relationship that the bodies of many animals had been incorporated into the flesh of the tree itself and the Old Flesh and the forest breathed all in time.

The Heart of the forest bid Mary and Scrimblo commune with it so that it might understand them and let them understand it in turn. Although they were reluctant - Scrimblo in particular - they agreed so long as it relinquished them after. It said that it would be their choice. Eve also promised to watch over them to make sure nothing untoward happened.

From the perspective of the Old Flesh, Mary and Scrimblo saw themselves differently. Mary was not a host to the parasites that she had incorporated into herself. Really, the idea that Mary was a single entity had continued based solely on the momentum of the thought. She had more in common with the multiple existence of the Old Flesh than she'd assumed.

Scrimblo, meanwhile, marked the difference between the consuming nature of the New Flesh and the mutualism of the Old Flesh. They were both flesh but the relationship each built with the world couldn't be more different. Once it was satisfied that Scrimblo understood, the Old Flesh offered to replace the Flesh within him with some of itself. It could not remove the flesh from him entirely but, fundamentally, all beings of this sphere were creatures of flesh. That didn't have to be a bad thing. Scrimblo accepted and felt the glasswork around the Flesh within him shatter.

Both adventurers chose to return to themselves and shared what they had experienced with the rest of the group. It was clear that the flesh of Cardia was no kin of the Flesh. Eve took a moment to reach out to the consciousness of the Heart to compare it to what she knew of the Seer, given that it had claimed that the Heart was its soul. They were both more entities of their own than parts of a single whole, at this point, particularly because the Seer had conceived of a grander vision for itself than the symbiosis the Heart favoured and the Heart had no desire to be incorporated back into the Seer.

It was at that point that the party realized that they had lost track of the Seer.

Mary spotted it at the edge of the sinkhole, speaking again with Constanze. Eve immediately climbed up to confront her. Constanze reiterated that she had truly had no designs on Cardia - she had long lost control over the Flesh here. However, her encounter with the Seer had gotten her thinking. Eve pointed out that the other Constanzes had not been willing to countenance working with the Seer but this Constanze said that she simply had a better idea of what would benefit the Flesh than the others.

What this scheme was, the party would not discover. Taking the preemptive strike, Constanze broke off negotiations by attacking Eve. The rest of the party sprung to her aid, with Mary managing to even the playing field by dragging Constanze down into the sinkhole. No longer in a 1-on-1 combat, she stood little chance against the party. In the confusion of the battle, however, the Seer had reached the Heart and begun the process of merging with it. Mary forced it to retreat while Eve repaired the damage it had done to the Heart but their differing views on what should be done about the Seer - with Mary thinking that it should be dealt with now and Eve insisting that they at least try to speak with it - afforded the Seer plenty of time to flee.

There was little chance of finding the Seer in the expansive forest, particularly if it did not want to be found, so the party returned to the matter of what to do about the Heart. On the whole, they believed it would be best to leave it be. Ukra was not wholly convinced until he communed with the Heart himself. It was made clear to him then that the Heart considered the people of Cardia part of itself - which also served as an explanation of why it had never spoken to them before. One didn't usually talk to their arms and legs.

Now in agreement with Eleazar, Ukra asked the party if they thought the Seer was a danger to the Heart. It likely would attempt to return if the Heart remained unattended. However, Eve wanted to make another attempt at speaking with it and volunteered to guard the tree while she waited to recover her ability to contact the Seer. Daphne had to return to Cardia but Ukra and the rest of the party were willing to remain.

Through the medium of dreams, Eve reached out to the Seer. It was frustrated by what it saw as the party's contradictory behaviour. They had allowed it to reincorporate the mind into itself but stopped it from regaining its soul. Eve tried to explain that the mind in Elbarai had been hurting people but the Heart was not only beneficial to the people of Cardia but taking it away would hurt them. The Seer did not care. It had begun to remember, now that its mind had been returned to it and it needed to return itself to its proper state so that it might return to its rightful place should be among the stars.

Eve said that they might be able to get a new soul for it by asking AIDA's god for aid but the Seer was unconvinced. A leg could be replaced or even a brain but a soul was what made a being who they are. A substitute would not do. Besides, beings as low as gods had nothing to do with its existence. If the party had no intention of helping it, it would take care of the matter itself.

After being forcibly ejected from the Seer's dreams, Eve shared what had happened and recommended that Cardia set a few hunters to guard the Heart against the Seer. All that remained for the party in Cardia was to obtain the information Ukra had originally promised them so they made their way back to the city to do just that. Upon their arrival, Eve received a magical courier from Jeremiah containing his personal effects and a letter.

The letter explained that this was a contingency activated by his death and that he had chosen to let old age finally take him. In addition to an explicit instruction not to revive him, Jeremiah's letter said that the party should return to the plateau and ask the kobolds about the storm that they worshipped as the mother of dragons. There was more there, he said, to be discovered. With that curious request, the party modified their plans to set out for the plateau once Ukra had found the documents about the mountains they had seen in Constanze's memories.
