# Session 5

Once the cultists had been dealt with, the party made their way back into Scrimblo. They whiled away the hours at the library, searching for any information about the disc that might aid them in their future endeavours. AIDA found a map that had been drawn before the incursion of the Flesh and, though it was possible that things had been warped in the intervening years, the largest settlements may have survived.

Beyond the southern Hell’s Reach mountains was the city of Aetra, famed for its mercenaries and strange system of governance. In the north lay the University of Elbarai and further east the farming city of Agranic. The final populous area of Eoril was a city of spun glass near the Obsidian Sands called Vitris. Scrimblo also pointed out the location of the forest where the incursion was reported to have begun. He had heard some cultists refer to it as the Bastion of Purity.

With their research done, the adventurers spent the remainder of their night at the theatre. Again, the engineers managed to pull off the seemingly impossible, having the tank re-plated by the morning.

The final excavated level of Scrimblo was still in fact an active mining project, little more than tunnels carved into the earth. Nevertheless, the party’s path was not straightfoward. Swarms of worms chased after the tank as it raced toward the root of the Flesh’s infection into the town of Scrimblo. Although the tendrils of the root and its guardians sought to destroy the party’s vehicle and subject them to a slow, agonizing death in the acid around them, the party was able to destroy them before it could do so.

With the tank hobbled but still functional, the party returned it to the engineers for repair before going to inform the mayor of their success. She was deeply grateful for their intervention and willing to speak to the Coalition forces at Zeta once things were settled in Scrimblo. AIDA, in communicating the mayor’s position to Felicity, learned that the downed airship would be needed to facilitate timely communication between the two sites. Vola had devised a plan to aid in bringing it back to the fort, one which she would be willing to fill them in on as soon as they returned.

Word of Recall brought the group back in the blink of an eye. AIDA provided a formal report to Felicity and Eva provided the archives with copies of her notes on the locations of the disc. The other three met with Vola to hear her plan. The fort was equipped with numerous walking artillery units constructed by Acacia and Gauss. Due to their unique design, these legs were modular and could be removed from the artillery and transported by the adventurers to the location of the fallen airship. There, they could be reattached, allowing the airship to be marched back to the fort for repairs in a safe environment. Having no other feasible option, the party made arrangements to head out the following day.

Eve took the opportunity to speak with the captive Purity priest. She attempted to interrogate him to little effect, though she learned that he and his sect were not familiar with Constanze. Their leader, then, represented another distinct threat to the disc. She made an effort to alleviate his injuries and treat him with respect, which was more than the Coalition soldiers ever afforded him.

For the hell of it, AIDA sought the divine intervention of her husband, the god known as the Lord of Flowers. His power was limited by the strange properties of the Flesh but He was able to at least make the airship skyworthy. The party quickly modified the plan to have them simply transport themselves and Hale to the airship, replace its balloon, and fly it back to the fort.

As expected, when they arrived at the crash site, they were immediately accosted by a number of creatures of the Flesh drawn by the strength of the magic that had brought them there.
