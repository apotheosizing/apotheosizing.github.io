# Session 24

With the bulk of Vitris’ forces fending off enemy cohorts from the northern and western flanks, the strike force was able to destroy one of the oasis towns. This effectively removed a third of the opposing army but came at the cost of an entire contingent of glassmages.

Over the following two days of combat, the army of Vitris tried to launch two concurrent marches on the remaining oasis towns to no avail. Vitris’ soldiers were spread too thin to both defend the city and destroy the outposts of the Prince’s city.

However, at the end of the fourth day of battle and after the destruction of some of the city’s most powerful spellcasters by all of the surviving fighters from Vitris, the Prince gave the order to retreat. The animate sphinx that carried the city did an about face and the two oases vanished as the sandstorm kicked up once again.

The victorious army’s return was both a celebration and a time for mourning. A number of casualties had been sustained even by the intact units and Vitris had truly only fended off their attackers by the skin of their teeth. Eve and AIDA offered to revive as many of the dead as Vitris could supply diamonds for but there would not be enough for all of the dead.

As they set up the requisite rituals, Darunia came over to speak with Eve. He begrudgingly admitted that the reinforcements from the Coalition had been essential in Vitris’ triumph but he was not keen to accept the assistance of outside forces again.

Yahg, by contrast, was deeply grateful for the party’s help and pledged to aid them as long as it was within his power. Eve asked if he was able to point them toward a large power source that could be used to replace the imprisoned celestial at the Holte estate.

Initially Yahg had no idea what she was referring to but, after an explanation, he concluded that a battery similar to the one used in the city might work. On the party’s next visit to the estate, he would send a wizard with them to provide an initial assessment and take the necessary measurements to create a new one from scratch.
