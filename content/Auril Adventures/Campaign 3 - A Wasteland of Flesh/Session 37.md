# Session 37

No sooner had Eve and Mary passed the walls of Vitris than the Prince's lich had ridden out on a dust devil formed of the same soul-sand that made up his phylactery. With a golem, a mummy of the city, and four of the people of the outlying settlements in his entourage, he outnumbered the party and his secured immortality freed him from any obligation to preserve his own "life".

Nevertheless, the adventurers were able to strike him down and on his last breath he laughed, saying that they had doomed the City of Glass. Knowing that this was no idle threat, the party quickly discussed their options for neutralizing the lich. They had successfully broken into the vault of the Prince once before but not only did they doubt the Prince would allow them to exploit those vulnerabilities again, they had no guarantees that the hourglass could be destroyed by any means at their disposal.

After some time they determined that while they could not satisfactorily resolve this matter now, they could not leave the city defenceless. The party warned the speakers in the tower of policy and informed Commander Jomora of the need to dispatch Coalition forces to Vitris once more and hoped that would be enough.

As the vault above the mesa suddenly seemed the simpler task, the party returned to the home of the kobolds in one exhaustive day of travel. Jeremiah's house had been disassembled by the time of their return but AIDA was able to conjure suitable accommodations for the night. During her morning prayers, AIDA beseeched the Lord of Flowers for intervention on behalf of Vitris and sensed that He had done what He could to aid them, though the party knew they would need to return there as soon as they received word from Felicity.

Flying in on the wind to siege the vault was impractical at best. Fortunately for the adventurers, Nimbus was able to shed some light on a measure they had put in place during the vault's construction. One of the many pillars on the mesa housed a tether that could be used to ground the dragon, or at least keep it close enough to the ground that bodily flight would do for approaching it. In combination with the manipulation of the local weather, two of the dragon's greatest assets would be mitigated.

This would not - and indeed did not - make the vault's external defences any less formidable. Even bound by the tether and with the full extent the lashing winds and biting lightning at its command suppressed, both Scrimblo and Mary fell in the battle. In the temporary vacancies of their souls, the parasites and the flesh of Cardia seized upon their malleable flesh, transforming them into multibodied and multilimbed monstrosities that continued the fight. The moment that AIDA had felled the vault, she and Eve split the duties of returning their companions to life to ensure they did not slip away into the hereafter in the intervening time.

Eve, with Mary, wondered if her eagerness to restore Mary to life - for she had barely hesitated to take one of AIDA's diamonds and pull Mary's soul back into her body - was an indication that she had failed to learn the lesson Athena had died to teach her. Mary did her best to assure Eve that it had been the right decision and that applying pure black-and-white thinking to the matter of death - just in the other direction - was not wisdom. Still, Eve worried over the matter and took flight to help Errol stem the tide of anxious kobolds that had already begun to move toward their fallen god.

AIDA, with Scrimblo, shared what she had seen in the battle with him, as he could not remember anything past his death. Scrimblo stopped her before she could get too deep into the gory details and did his best to remind himself that the old flesh that existed within him now was not the same force that had devoured the disc. AIDA suggested that he might ask Yahg for another glass treatment to contain the flesh if he was afraid of it gaining control but Scrimblo felt sure that it would not be held at bay by anything other than his own will. She promised that she would help him do so as best she could.

The voice of Nimbus gave one final piece of information to the party: though the vault's external defences and primary lock had been disengaged, these were not its only means of dealing with intruders. They had designed its internal weaponry to be less destructive but warned that these initial specifications had likely been built upon over the centuries.

This alarmed the party with the suggestion that the dragon was able to construct additional defences itself without oversight until they clarified that they had left a minor celestial within the construct to direct these improvements as it saw fit. It had agreed to the position when Nimbus had offered it to them but the intervening time may have soured its loyalty to Gond and thus they recommended approaching it with caution.

The party decided, then, that they would wait until the following day to enter the vault lest they be destroyed in their weakened states. With Errol's assistance, they were able to placate the worries of the kobolds with the promise that the dragon would soon take to the skies again - something they could only hope the celestial would agree to when the confronted within.
