# Session 23

Agranic was not much better off than Vitris. Much of the farmland had been burnt and barricades had been erected around the castle. The Javelin was able to land inside the barricades and Millicent explained what had happened. With the absence of both the king and the archbishop and the resulting power vacuum, the general populace was worried that the church - being the only remaining institution in the city - would install an autocrat to keep Agranic’s monotheism intact. A small-scale mob violence had sprouted up, resulting in the current situation.

As much as the party had an instinct to help, Vitris was in immediate danger. Sepharial was happy to take the diamond from the party and release them from their contracts with Waukeen. She also offered to ~~war profiteer~~ aid the party, and Vitris by extension, but they weren’t particularly keen to accrue another debt.

However, the party doubted they would be able to make a meaningful impact in the conflict alone. None of them were particularly happy about it but seeking help from the Coalition was the only other option. AIDA recalled the party to Fort Zeta to arrange a contingent of reinforcements with Felicity. The mere confirmation that this involved the Flesh was enough for her to agree to provide troops to assist Vitris, though they would not arrive until the Javelin could transport them.

With that, the party wind walked to Vitris. Despite the speed of their return, it was obvious on their approach that Vitris had already been attacked by the Prince’s city. One of the spires had been destroyed and the walls were deeply scratched by the grains of the sandstorm. An emergency meeting had been called at the tower of policy where four speakers presented suggestions for the city’s response.

Yahg was advocating for full mobilization, including the use of the Flesh suits, a man named Darunia agreed but refused to sanction the use of the suits, the mage Elkelin wanted to defend the city by encasing it in a magical dome, and a woman named Aphra urged the Vitris to pursue diplomacy. During the recess, Yahg called the party over to speak to them. He asked for their help in convincing the other three to support his cause.

The party spoke to Darunia first. Even in the face of the potential annihilation of the city, he was unwilling to support the use of the Flesh suits. None of the party’s arguments seemed to convince him until Eve essentially blackmailed him by threatening to withhold the reinforcements they’d secured from the Coalition. He reluctantly agreed to back Yahg’s position.

Elkelin was certain that the city could hold out against attacks from the Prince’s city for as long as necessary until they yielded. Mary doubted that, since the city was filled with immortal, implacable beings who were willing to wait for *years* to break the siege. He faltered on hearing that but the party was able to rally his spirits by suggesting they could use magical shields in the battle.

Aphra believed that this entire situation must have been a misunderstanding, since Vitris did nothing to provoke the city. The party explained that their theft of the diamond was being used as an excuse and she immediately pivoted to suggest they simply turn themselves in. When the party further explained that the Prince’s city had basically facilitated it, she accepted that there was no talking them out of the conflict.

As the de-facto winner of the debate, Yahg quickly began consulting both with his fellow speakers and with the party to devise a plan of attack. Scouts and spies estimated four days before the city’s next attack and, though the Coalition forces wouldn’t arrive in time, Vitris was far from defenceless.

Over the course of several days, AIDA and Eve were able to manipulate the weather into a torrential downpour that would negate much of the destructive power of the sandstorm. As they worked, Mary was able to provide a rough map of enemy movements using blood cartography and the blood of an assassinated soldier to allow them to shape their preparations. While they were required to keep their attention on the spell, they were both able to provide a few more defences in the form of hallowing against undead and making some pillars of stone for the archers to use to their advantage. The glass mages set up a number of glass shields between them to form a basic perimeter.

After the first day of fighting, which tallied only one loss of a Flesh suit on Vitris’ side, the Javelin arrived with a heavy infantry unit from Fort Zeta. Observing troop movements over the course of the engagement led the party to conclude that there were a few oases where the enemy had set up bases of operation. For the second day of battle, the party gathered a small group of specialized soldiers to accompany them to the nearest oasis with the goal of destroying it, leaving the rest of the army to defend Vitris in their absence.
