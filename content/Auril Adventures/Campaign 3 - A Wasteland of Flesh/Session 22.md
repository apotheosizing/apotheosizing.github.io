# Session 22

The party reconvened at the library, where each group caught the other up with what had transpired. Two days remained until the public appearance of the Prince to which Eve had won an invitation so Vamir offered to allow the party to stay at his home in the meantime.

The following day, two party invitations arrived - one from Ruvyn and one from Jastira - for a small private party. Vamir quickly identified the true purpose of the event: to trade around invitations to the Prince’s appearance. As three of the four adventurers would need one if they planned to get into the third tier of the city legitimately (and no one seemed particularly keen on Eve transforming everyone else into animals), they figured this would be their best opportunity.

The party was being held in a luxurious bathhouse and restoration parlor. The group split up to meet with their respective contacts. Ruvyn excitedly informed AIDA that she had won her the bet that had brought her to the library. As thanks for her and Scrimblo’s assistance, she provided one of the three invitations they would need without any further requests.

Once that was done, they met up with the rest to try their hands at another of Jastira’s games. AIDA suggested dragonchess - a game she had literally never played before - and against all odds managed to win an invitation from him. Mary obtained another second in the same fashion, making a total of four. However, this briefly caused her to go mad with power and attempt to take all the rest of the invitations on offer.

While she did so everyone else went to see what was happening in the last alcove of the bathhouse. A strange game was being conducted that involved trapping two people (identified as people who lived down in the oasis and thus were second-class citizens) in rooms that would either desiccate or steam them. The two men outside the rooms could only open their door and win the game if their opponent’s hostage had died before theirs. Eve was horrified by this and tried her best to surreptitiously preserve the lives of the hostages while talking the players out of the game.

She had little luck and, not wanting to cause a scene that might have unexpected consequences, offered to at least revive whoever was dead when the game was over. The players indicated this would not be effective as the lich who lived in the palace often immediately snatched up the souls of those who died in the city. AIDA, having no real compunctions about keeping things civil, simply forced one of the players aside and opened his door, ending the game.

The group made their excuses and left the party soon after. Back in the privacy of Vamir’s home, they wondered to what extent they should factor in the presence of a lich to their plans to break into the palace. If they were lucky, he would be accompanying the Prince out to meet the masses, but they doubted it would be so easy.

When the day of the Prince’s appearance arrived, however, they found that it was simpler than they anticipated. Crowds had begun to gather hours before the start proper and the party made sure that they were among them. Eve, in wild shape, went off alone to see what defences they would be up against at the palace. A quick circle of the building revealed little to be worried about and, unlike the city itself, the palace was laid out rather straightforwardly.

Those back on the streets of the city noticed that there seemed to be very little security despite the impending presence of the most vulnerable person in the city. As such, when Eve returned, the party opted to simply sneak away in animal shapes to take advantage of the lapse.

Reaching the vault doors was almost trivial. Above them was written a warning that any who enter would bear “the bane of time” which, while being ominous, was likely nothing the party couldn’t deal with magically. Beyond the doors sat a small display room that resembled Maeveiane’s treasure room writ large and at its centre was a pale construct that stood to greet them. Rather than attempt to deceive him, the party admitted to being thieves. The construct said that their honesty was refreshing but that he would not allow them to pass without a fight. His ability to absorb most magic dragged the fight out but with Scrimblo’s martial ability and the higher tiers of magic available to the casters in the party, they were able to dispatch the construct.

The next chamber of the vault was entirely occupied by what appeared to be a massive hourglass filled with black sand but observing it for a time revealed a strange property. The hourglass flashed with light every so often and closer inspection revealed that these were screaming faces that flared up briefly before sinking back into the sand. With the intention of freeing any souls that might be trapped inside it, Eve smacked it with the butt of her spear. This activated protective measures in the form of lasers that reduced both AIDA and Eve to ashes and gravely injuring Mary and Scrimblo.

After a few minutes of panic, the survivors noticed that AIDA remained in the form of a small hovering flame. AIDA speculated that this was due to her status as a celestial. She and Eve were the only members of the party capable of resurrection or transporting something as large as the diamond, leaving their infiltration in limbo. Just as they’d decided to turn back, AIDA made a last ditch effort to salvage things and asked for help from the Lord of Flowers. He answered and restored both AIDA and Eve to life.

Eve profusely apologized for being so rash and everyone decided that they should find the diamond and get out as soon as possible. Fortunately, the diamond was in the next room they entered. It was filled with a strange mist that likely represented some form of warding but it was easily dispelled. With effort from all four of the adventurers and the use of magical enhancements, they were able to lift the diamond, allowing AIDA to recall them all to the deck of the Javelin.

A quick sending to Sepharial confirmed that they could drop the diamond off at the temple in Agranic. Eager to be done with this errand, the Javelin set off at once. As they darted away, the city of the Prince disappeared. At first the party assumed that their theft was the cause but they quickly found that the city was in fact mobilizing to attack Vitris. In combination with the suspicious ease with which they had been able to access the vault, the party realized that they had been set up.
