# Session 30

Eyes and lips embedded in the Flesh watched the approach of the adventurers as they returned to the resting place of the Grand Seer. From their writhing it was clear that Constanze remained opposed to their plan but it fell to the offshoot cult to stop them.

Isaac insisted that he and his fellows had no intention of fighting the party. They would only do what was required to keep the Seer where it was. Since they had not initiated hostilities, Eve had the opportunity to contact the Seer and inform it that they had brought it a humanoid body. It had its own means of transferring its consciousness into this new form so, thankfully, all the party had to do was deal with the Purity cultists.

As it worked on connecting its nervous system to that of the vessel, the party verbally engaged the cultists with the hope that they could be dissuaded before things came to blows. The primary reason that the party was doing this at all was that the Seer was unhappy in its current form. The cultists countered with the concern that it may not like its new body either. Though the possibility existed, the party was certain they could find something suitable eventually.

More important to the cultists was the potential loss of the Seer's power if it was allowed to leave. The party were not intending to take it away but it was true that the Seer did not seem to have a particularly good relationship with the cult. The party suggested that they try to actually treat it as a being rather than a machine that spat out prophecies. The cultists were recalitrant about this, insisting that they had done no such thing.

In a last ditch effort to make a fight unappealing, the party reminded the cultists that they were far outmatched in combat. The cultists tried to refute this with a demonstration of magic but AIDA dispelled it with ease.

At last the Seer had completed its transfer into the new body. The death of its previous form created a magical backlash that killed Isaac, scattering the cultists and de facto winning the argument for the party. The Seer had some initial difficulty adjusting to a smaller form with less brainpower but AIDA was able to alleviate this with a bit of magic. After a few minutes the Seer began to examine the party in earnest. It was very interested in Scrimblo, given that it perceived him as likewise being Flesh that had been put into a body but Scrimblo quickly corrected it.

With introductions completed, the Seer started heading toward the airship. It informed the adventurers that it wanted to go to Elbarai, the Lone Mountain, and Cardia in order to retrieve its mind, body, and a fragment of its soul. Since the party was intending to go to Elbarai and Cardia in the near future, they were willing to allow it to accompany them. Before setting off for Elbarai, however, they needed to stop by Fort Zeta. Bringing the Seer with them would likely go over well with Commander Jomora so AIDA opted to use her recall point at the abandoned northwestern fort to take herself, Scrimblo, and the Seer there. Eve, Mary, and the airship would deliver the party's report and resupply before meeting them there.

Thanks to AIDA's divine intervention there several weeks ago, the fort was a pleasant temperature for a place so high in the mountains, with a number of animals and flowers growing there. The Seer was fascinated by this and spent the entire time staring at various things.

AIDA took the opportunity to ask Scrimblo if he was ever going to talk to Eve about what happened at the Holte estate. Scrimblo confessed that he had been avoiding it mostly out of fear of how it would go and a reasonable concern that Mary might stab him. AIDA reassured him that if she did so, AIDA would revive him and stab Mary back for good measure, since she and Scrimblo were friends. Scrimblo, who hadn't had a friend since his infection by the Flesh, was deeply touched by this and said he would try to talk to Eve at some point soon.

Meanwhile, at the fort, Eve and Mary informed Felicity that they would be heading north to Elbarai. She found this acceptable and wished them luck on their way. They also observed that the Coalition engineers had managed to put together one of the crab tanks used in Scrimblo (town) thanks to the relationship the party had helped establish between the two settlements. Eventually, they would be deploying more troops in these tanks to better secure the inhabited areas of the disc.

After picking up the other half of the party, the Javelin turned its heading toward Elbarai. The landscape below them subtly changed as they approached the reported location of the city of magic, turning grey with decaying Flesh. The Seer noted that this area seemed to be filled with Flesh that had been disconnected from the whole, much like itself.

The city of Elbarai had grown up around a central university but it appeared entirely abandoned from above. However, much like the Holte estate before it, the Javelin ran up against a barrier as they neared Elbarai. A ghostly apparition appeared aboard the Javelin to warn them to turn back lest he be forced to remove them. Elbarai was closed to visitors due to an ongoing emergency situation. He was particularly perturbed by the presence of the Seer.

Eve was able to coax the ghost into explaining what had happened. He told the group that Elbarai had been overrun by the forces of the Flesh seeking to gain control of something held deep within the university. When the Flesh overtook the disc, almost every resident of Elbarai with any magical ability was absorbed into a large Fleshy amalgam of brain tissue.

The ghost himself - a priest of Ilmater by the name of Henri - had died in the initial conflict but two of his colleagues remained locked in the university, holding off the Flesh. His description of the current situation revealed that a Constanze was present in Elbarai attempting to do something with the power of the brain, though he couldn't say what. The party was sure they would be able to help and attempted to convince the ghost of their good intentions but he absolutely refused to allow them in with the Seer.

After a short debate where the party leaned on the enmity between the Seer and Constanze, they were able to convince Henri to allow them in under the condition that they not simply allow the Seer to take the brain from Elbarai. He wanted to see the people who had been trapped within it put to rest, not used for the Seer's ends, even if they were supposedly at odds with Constanze's.

Henri reluctantly disclosed that he and his colleagues each possessed a fragment of an amulet that would, when reconstituted, be an aid to them in reaching Constanze and the brain. He provided the party directions to his office, where his fragment lay, but he would have to convince the rest of his colleagues themselves. With that, he disappeared, allowing them through the barrier.

The ghost had emphasized that the university was an active battleground but the party heard it firsthand as the flew over to its grounds - screams still echoed from the city below...
