# Session 8

As the Javelin sped toward its heading, it approached the God’s Grave. Its name, Scrimblo explained, sprung from the cap of one of the mountains, which had broken off and slid down into the nearby lowland. For those who believe that its name is more than fancy, there are many tales about whose corpse lies beneath the stone.

Along the eastern fork of the mountains, a lone fort was visible, struggling against an active incursion of the Flesh. It became obvious that the defenders of the fort were fighting a losing battle but the adventurers could not afford to stop when Jeremiah’s condition was unknown, particularly since even five skilled people could not turn back such a tide. However, AIDA prayed for the intercession of the Lord of Flowers on their behalf. Immediately, white lillies bloomed around the fort, conferring some unclear form of protection onto the soldiers.

Further northwest lay the Holte Estate, the place that Skald had named as the home of the vampires. Curiously there was a clear delineation where the advance of the Flesh had stopped in a perfect ring around the grounds of the castle. More than ever, interest was piqued in the mysterious estate but again proper investigations would have to wait. Hale, who had availed himself of newspapers from the home disc, remarked that there had been a remarkable decrease in the activity of the Long Knives in the last several weeks, which led most of the party to look at Mary for some reason.

As the edge of the disc approached, a massive stormcloud grew larger and larger on the horizon. It hovered above a wide, raised mesa that had likewise escaped the influence of the Flesh, presumably due to its proximity to the sealing Ice. Its only obvious manmade feature was a small shack that offered some relief to the adventurers by its mere existence. Indeed when they landed they learned that Jeremiah was in relatively safe conditions. As he told it, the voyage of the Icebreaker II had begun with promise. Jeremiah had in tow two students from disc Iota, direct apprentices of an archmage Orsino. Though his friendship with Jeremiah had ended during the collapse of the Subnetwork, his students Cyril and Anne Lupine had no involvement in that business and were clearly eager to learn all that Jeremiah could teach them.

In actuality, they were slowly depriving him of his most useful spells by asking for demonstrations of more obscure magic, to the point that when they launched their mutiny, Jeremiah had little means to defend himself other than cantrips and his draconic transformation. During the ensuing battle, the Icebreaker was rent in two and part of it, the part that now made up the material of his shack, fell on him as the vessel and crew fell onto the mesa, resulting in the loss of mobility in his legs and the loss of the jade circlet needed for his shapechange spell.

Fortunately, a group of kobolds who mistook his draconic form for his true appearance witnessed the fall. They were able to provide him with care and shelter, as well as assistance in recovering what they could from the wreck of the Icebreaker, but were unwilling to let him leave. In the past several years, he had encounter no other survivors of the incident. Eve was able to regenerate his legs but Jeremiah would need some time to recover and build his strength before he would walk again.

About that time, a representative from the kobolds named Errol arrived to see what the cause of all the commotion at the shack was. He was very surprised to see the party but was happy to assist them when they indicated they wanted to help Jeremiah. Errol explained that the kobolds had searched for the circlet under the cultivated misunderstanding that it held an important magic to the “dragon” Jeremiah. The jade had been smashed and several pieces had been recovered from the local wyvern population but the final piece remained lost.

AIDA or Eve would be able to search for the fragment magically, but only after some time to prepare the spell. Thus, they would spend the night on the mesa. Errol left them to their own devices, though he warned them away from the stormcloud, which he said housed their revered mother dragon.

The following day, AIDA pinpointed the location of the last fragment. Beneath the storm were a formation of tall stones that the wyverns called home and it seemed that their leader was in possession of the final jade piece. Not only were the wyverns dangerous, the stones served as lightning rods, amplifying the danger of the storm. Even so, the party was willing to brave it and as luck would have it they had someone on their side to even the odds.

Throughout the battle, several arrows were fired at the wyverns by a mysterious third party who the party could not identify through the whipping wind and rain. With their aid and a careful strategy, the adventurers were able to retrieve the jade fragment. All that remained was to repair the circlet to satisfy the kobolds and they could be on their way.
