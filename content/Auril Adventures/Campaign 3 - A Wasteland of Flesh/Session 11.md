# Session 11

AIDA wiped out the acolytes in a single spell, evening the odds of the battle. The guards, likewise, quickly fell, though the higher priests held their own long enough that one fled through a door to the southwest.

This door initially stymied the party’s progress, as it had no doorknob, but the eye carved into its surface clued them in to the need to bring a cultist to it to open it. Fortunately a corpse would do. However, the time needed to open the door allowed the escaped priest to confer with another of their rank, sending them down the hall to call for backup while they delayed the party.

The diversion did not last long and Scrimblo was able to strike them down before any additional cultists were alerted. To the north, the party encountered another fleshkin who was in the midst of tidying. They were plugged into one of the nerves they had seen the cultists connected to and did not initially notice the adventurers’ presence. They were confused by being interrupted but not particularly bothered.

In the south, a room filled with various art pieces caught the party’s interest, as there was a painting depicting a minotaur above all the ranks of priests. If the work was contemporary, it suggested that the leader of the cult of Purity was this individual.

Heading east, they encountered a new emblem on the doors: a seven-fingered hand. Using the dead priest’s hand allowed them to approximate the proper flesh-shaping to open the way. A map of the disc had been hung on the back wall, containing information about a number of locations relevant to the cult. Almost directly south, some manner of void in the influence of the Flesh was marked, as well as a place described with an eye. Interestingly, the city of Agranic appeared to have escaped the tide of Flesh.

When they next encountered priests, they were in the midst of a delicate surgery, attempting to retrieve memories from the brain of a recently deceased prisoner. Eve and Mary were able to extract this information in their cultist guises and retreat without violence. In a nearby pod chamber, Mary found a hidden holy symbol to Ilmater, the god of suffering, which suggested a number of possible things about the fleshkin.

Beyond a door with an ear carved on it, which opened to Eve telling it to open in Druidic, the party found the beheaded prisoner, who by their garb was a member of the Coalition. With the aim of reviving the scout, the party returned to the two priests to retrieve the brain but they found the room empty.

Crossing the main hall to the eastern half of the floor, the party encountered a chamber covered in writing that revealed the five tenets of the cult. These tenets quickly proved useful, as the ear door to the north opened to the third tenet. Here, two high priests were in the process of ritually flaying a low priest to elevate him to a higher position, a ceremony that the party put a bloody end to.

Another variety of door, marked with a mouth, required a small sacrifice of blood to enter a workshop where a number of cultists were practicing the forms of manmade objects. Some members of the priesthood felt this to be a blasphemous practice while others acknowledged the need to adapt to new strategies. Eve took the opportunity to ask after the leader before the hidden members party attacked the unsuspecting cultists, learning that he had spent the past several years meditating in the canopy of Beacon.

Once the room was cleared of its occupants, the party took the opportunity to rest, sensing that they would soon be traveling up into the canopy to do battle with the head of the priesthood himself.
