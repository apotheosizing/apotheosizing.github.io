# Session 32

Use of the amulet allowed the party to dispel the barrier around the amalgam. Their past encounters with Constanze had involved her usual pontificating on the nature of the Flesh but this Constanze was completely silent. It quickly became apparent why - the entire back of her head had been sliced out to remove her brain. Nevertheless, she was capable of holding her own in a fight.

As the party worked to destroy the amalagam, it reached out to make psychic contact with them. They glimpsed the last moments of the student body and then... the scene changed. A grand hall formed of platinum played host to a meeting. One of them was familiar to Eve and Mary - the cleric Nimbus - and the owner of the memory knew the names of the rest. Marina, Achuak, Strums-the-Weave, and Erdan, Constanze's fellow Hands of Mystral.

She disdained their useless plotting to destroy the Enemy as much as their self-righteousness, for she had her own plan in which she was confident. Before the party could see what it entailed (though they certainly knew its outcome), Constanze forced them out of contact with the amalgam, saying that they had no right to that information.

Once Constanze was dead and the amalgam had been disabled, the party debated the three requests of Elbarai's deans. Vluerona had shared a half-formed idea to return the students to a temporal point before their transformation but the adventurers felt that the best thing for the students would be to release their souls from the amalgam by destroying it. The Seer consumed the central piece of the amalgam, regaining the brain that it sought.

At the party's request, it showed them the remainder of the memory. Constanze traveled to a range of mountains beneath which lay the mind of the Enemy. She brought all of her magical power to bear against It and succeeded in shattering Its mind. However, in the moment of vulernability afforded by her attack, the Enemy struck back. To preserve Its life, It grafted Constanze's being to its own, using her magic to fuel Its diminished existence.

When the party came back to their senses, they realized that the timeloop had collapsed, leaving Vluerona free to join them. She was devasted by the fate the party had chosen for the students absorbed into the amalgam but there was nothing she could do about it. Endings were no longer something she was used to. Ashur-Shaduni, after arranging his affairs, came to discuss the future of Elbarai. The party offered to bring the survivors to Fort Zeta, where they could seek the aid of the Coalition in rebuilding the city. With few other options available to them, Ashur-Shaduni and Vluerona agreed to join them on the Javelin's return trip.

The Fort was in a state of controlled chaos. Felicity explained to the party that apparently the true nature of the Coalition's misson on the disc had gotten out to the general public some weeks ago and a flurry of correspondence had come in over the past day. The nuances of the political fiasco that would likely be caused by this were far above her paygrade but she did deliver a large volume to fanmail to the adventurers. Scrimblo in particular was very touched by the idea that people viewed him as a hero, though he wondered if they would still feel that way if they knew that he had been infected by the Flesh.

By the time the party had read most of the mound of letters, Felicity had read their brief report on Elbarai. She agreed that locating the mountain where Constanze had attacked the Enemy would likely be instrumental in mounting their final assault on the Flesh and encouraged the party to do so after visiting Cardia and Aetra. Of the two, Cardia, being the inception point of the spread of the Flesh, was the obvious starting point for gathering that information. And so the party departed for the birthplace of the Flesh, in the hope that the Red Cloaks could shed some light on what they'd seen.
