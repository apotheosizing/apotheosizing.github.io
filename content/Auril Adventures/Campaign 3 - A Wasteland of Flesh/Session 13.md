# Session 13

As the Javelin approached the Holte estate, Scrimblo filled the others in on what he knew of the area. In days gone by, the armies of the Holte estate destroyed all other vampires on the disc in a crusade, leaving them as the only vampires on Zeta. Word from within Holte lands claimed that the mortals living there enjoyed a high quality of life under the rule of the current lord Bertram Holte.

Bizarrely, the Flesh surrounding the Holte lands appeared to be pale and almost exsanguinated. Just as the party was wondering what the cause could be, they were attacked by a number of large bats bloated with blood. It was a fairly obvious conclusion that they had been feasting on the Flesh.

Once they were within the invisible barrier that held out the Flesh, AIDA noted that she immediately felt unwell. None of the other adventurers felt similarly, not even Eve, which made them all concerned for AIDA, but as her condition was not debilitating and there was nothing they were sure would work, they decided to try to look into it.

Three settlements were visible from the air. The party determined that they should land at the one nearest the southeastern edge of the area that they had approached from, but they were intercepted by the appearance of a man in blue armour, accompanied by several soldiers bearing a standard of a seven-tined sun. He requested permission to come aboard and speak with the newcomers to his lands. The party agreed.

The man introduced himself as Lord Holte and welcomed the party with open arms. They bombarded him with questions about everything from the presence of the strange bats to the possible source of AIDA’s discomfort. With some embarrassment, Bertram explained that the bats were former members of his clan who turned their back on the faith and turned back to darkness. He was the one maintaining the magical barrier to kept the Flesh at bay but he could not easily teach the technique to anyone else. He also could not offer any insight into the matter of AIDA.

The party bade him farewell before finishing their descent to the town of Tornik. It was relatively small but surprisingly advanced technologically speaking. Its people were excited by the presence of strangers and quite polite to all of the adventurers as they asked questions and looked around.

Each of the five split up as much as they could to cover ground around Tornik. No matter where they went, they found that people had nothing but good things to say about Bertram, though they did not like discussing the infrequent *requests* he made of them. He provided for his citizens needs more than adequately, even producing the power to run all four of the settlements on his lands and dispatching knowledgeable machinists to deal with repairs.

Or rather, all three of the settlements on his lands, as the party learned that one of the town had recently been destroyed in a fire started by an incursion of the bat-like vampires. At Tornik’s library, Scrimblo was able to find a few books on the Holtes, though the only thing they contained that he did not know was that his line was prone to arithmomania.

With nothing else particularly pressing on the table, the party decided to head for the destroyed town of Strabor. It was easily identified at a distance from the small military encampment that had been set up to support humanitarian efforts there. The injured were being tended to by doctors using non-magical methods and a group of machinists were working to repair and reroute power from heavily damaged areas to get things back up and running as soon as they could. The party offered their assistance where they could.

Curiously, AIDA realized that she felt minutely better in Strabor. She communed with the Lord of Flowers in the hope that He might know why. The Lord of Flowers told her that she was sensing divinity, though He could not explain why that would make her feel so badly. He assured her, however, that it would not cause her any physical harm, only discomfort.

While the party took a break from their work around Strabor, Eve took the opportunity to scry on Bertram. He was in the middle of a hunt in the woods, chasing after one of his transformed former kin. The party quickly realized that it was the small forest near this town when they heard the disturbance among the trees. They rushed in to assist Bertram in fighting the vampire. Due to the use of some illusion magic during the battle, Bertram ended up accidentally striking Eva, which led him to apologize profusely - truthfully, to an extent that seemed excessive. She was a bit puzzled but Eva assured him all the same that all was well. Only after he was sure he had not offended her did he turn to his erstwhile kin.

It was clear from his demeanor that he intended only death for the vampire. Mary, being devoted to the Lord of Bats, asked Bertram to spare the creature but he could not be swayed. Without so much as a moment’s hesitation, he decapitated the former member of his clan. Mary turned away into the woods, followed by a concerned Eve, as Bertram politely extended an invitation for dinner at his estate proper that night.

Between Bertram’s uncompromising ideological position and his ruthless chase of the vampire through the woods, Mary was struggling to deal with his actions in the context of her own treatment by the people of her village. Eve did her best to talk Mary down but, in all honesty, Eve was not well-equipped to say no to Mary.

She managed to tell Mary that although of course she wanted to help her, she felt that Mary often did not do the right thing. Bertram overall seemed to be a good man who made occasional missteps or moral compromises due to his nature. Unless he was truly evil, Eve - and likely the rest of the party - would not be justified in hurting him.

Since this reasoning was coming from Eve, Mary agreed to hold off for the time being, though she seemed certain that the party would uncover something that would justify her desire to kill him before long.
