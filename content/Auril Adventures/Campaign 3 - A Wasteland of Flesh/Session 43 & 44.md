# Session 43 & 44

Viewed from the Hell's Reach mountains, Eoril's horizon was dwarfed by the titanic mountain simulacrum of Jebediah Mann. Out of some sense of courtesy (or perhaps self-importance) a smaller avatar, one that more closely resembled the man whom Eve and Mary had encountered thirty years prior, was brought forth to treat with the party.

Accordingly he mused in a nostalgic mode: how naive that man had been, to think himself king of all creation when he was nothing more than the lord of a single hamlet. He had so much more to grasp - and he would, once the minor obstacles of the adventurers were eliminated.

Jebediah's many years intertwined with the Flesh had greatly enhanced his magical prowess and he fought the party with not only spellcraft but the might of the mountain behind him: simply the press of its massive hand into the Flesh around them was enough to maim or destroy. With Scrimblo's will subsumed by the Flesh to which he was host and Mary unconscious, their triumph over Jebediah was achieved by a slim margin indeed.

The dissolution of the avatar caused the titan to halt in its approach to Aetra, allowing the party the opportunity to climb aboard it and carry out the material of Jebediah's false promise: the destruction of the mountain from the inside

Much as before, the internal landscape of the Flesh had been warped by Jebediah's will to resemble, at least in passing, the design of his old manor, though a wet heat that called to mind unsettlingly the environment within a mouth or a stomach made any real comparison impossible. A slow-seeping poisonous gas began to fill up the entranceway again but rather than fleeing into the safety of fresh air, the party moved deeper into the mountain. 

Heading east, they came to a chamber formed of overlapping limbs. At the end of the room was a set of the same wrapped protectively around something. Scrimblo and Eve were able to pry the arms away to reveal a small owlbear chick. Eve immediately tried to see if it was harmed or sick but the chick was nothing more than another trap of the mountain which detonated with enough explosive force to catch everyone except Mary with its force.

The party continued through the halls of the manor to the north. The next room of the manor was unremarkable but for a thumping sound coming from behind the west wall. Approaching it made it clear that there was a breathing creature behind it and, although they were wary after the incident with the owlbear, Scrimblo cut away a flap of flesh to reveal a tiefling. Once he had recovered from his ordeal, he introduced himself as Malady, an adventurer from Aetra. Like many others, he had come to the mountain to try to deal with one of the creatures it spawned and been absorbed when it began moving under Jebediah's direction. He was happy to tag along with the party until they were done here.

The path through the mountain bent back to the south before depositing the party in a slimy room filled with pustules. Lancing these revealed a death kiss and two howlers lurking inside but they posed little threat to the adventurers. Beyond, there lay a tall cylindrical room with many sphincters expanding and contracting. Through the periodic openings, a faint glint of something metallic could be seen. Eve, in the form of a hummingbird, darted through the sphincters to find a pristine pair of boots on a partially-digested corpse. She retrieved them and returned to the rest of the group.

Doubling back to the room where they had fought the death kiss and taking a different door, the party entered into a room that had a facsimile of furniture. The misshapen forms of household staff had been formed into a chair on which sat Jebediah Mann with a large tumorous wolfhound at his feet. He was a young man in appearance but, from the amused glint in his eye, no less himself in essence. Mary refused to let him get so much as a word out before attacking. He quickly yielded to the party's onslaught and the base matter that made him was reabsorbed into the Flesh.

Another scene from the past awaited them as they delved deeper. A pillar of flesh stretched to the ceiling, with a half-consumed body of Jebediah Mann hanging partially out of it. Unlike the younger man they'd fought moments before, this husk was empty, for when it opened its mouth it was not to speak but to project a disintegrating ray that Eve, who was standing closest, only narrowly evaded. The party left the corpse to its consumption and continued on into the mountain...
