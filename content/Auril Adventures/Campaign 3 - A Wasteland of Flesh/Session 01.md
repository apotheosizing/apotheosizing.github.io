# Session 1

On an otherwise unremarkable afternoon, the arrival of a courier kicked up a stir in the hamlet. Dressed in Coalition blue, he sped past a miffed Josiah to deliver an urgent missive to Eve and Mary. The letter was brief and light on particulars but Mary was immediately interested in what the Coalition described as a dangerous task. Eve was more hesitant, but she agreed that it would be to their benefit to learn more of what had been preoccupying the Coalition of late.

After the pair informed Vyrana and Korvias of their plans, they parted ways to say their goodbyes. Eve walked into the grove that had grown around her in the forest. The creatures that had gathered there were grey with age but remained just as they had when she had first imbued the area with magic upon her return from the expedition over the ice. Athena, too, was less energetic than they used to be yet still ready to travel with Eve if called upon.

Eve, who had not physically aged a day since her arrival in the hamlet, was sure that there was at least one last adventure in them. As she and Athena departed the grove, the people of the hamlet seemed to have more of a spring in their step than they had for months. Meanwhile, Mary bade farewell to a relieved Josiah, who was happy to again escape whatever mad things happened on these trips out of the hamlet.

Halfway across Auril, a private investigator and a traveling construct received letters of their own. Both were eager to accept, Eva out of pure curiosity and AIDA seeking to assist wherever she could.

The Coalition couriers escorted the recruits to the teleporations hubs for their disc. Travel through the various gates was light but steady, with merchants and visitors streaming in and out of the hub. Upon the arrival of the couriers, the guards ushered out any civilian traffic. When the disused gate to disc Zeta was opened only the adventurers and the members of the Coalition were there to see it.

Surprisingly, Hub Zeta itself was filled with activity. Military personnel moved about the space with clear purpose, though they spared a glance at the newcomers in between the carefully followed routine.

Two women approached the party. The woman in uniform introduced herself as Felicity Jomora and her companion in robes as Nazena lastname.

One year ago, her predecessor had spearheaded an incursion into disc Zeta that had won them control of the hub but otherwise failed to make much headway. Since her appointment as commander, all available resources have been focused on holding the ground they’d gained. However, it was obvious that the situation was untenable and she had called in the party in order to gather the information they were sorely lacking.

AIDA and Eva asked questions while Eve and Mary remained silent with a horrible feeling that they knew more about the state of this disc than the Coalition. When Eva asked about the nature of the threat the Coalition faced, Felicity ushered the adventurers outside where they walked into a firefight waged on the walls of the city against the land itself. It rose up in strange limbs and creatures of flesh, only just held back by the soldiers. Felicity noted, in the voice of someone for whom this sight was not new, that every time they used the teleportation hub, the Flesh reacted violently.

Nazena elaborated on the few things they knew about the threat. It reacted negatively to large expenditures of magic - such as the teleportation hub - and to the movements of large groups of people. This had been the cause of most Coalition losses in the area. 

Eve added a few pertinent details, including the likely cause of the conditions on Zeta, by explaining what had happened at Hub Theta. Once everyone had digested that information, AIDA and Eva indicated an interest in exploring the area. Felicity requested that, if they did, they search the wreckage of the airship they had deployed the night before. It had gone down to the east in an attack by a roc and though no survivors were expected, it was possible.

Several hours earlier, a dragonborn named Scrimblo was conducting a search of his own. He had seen the airship’s crash and hoped he might be able to save the people inside before it was swallowed up by the Flesh. Though he had to battle through the tentacles enfolding the ship, he was able to escape with the sole survivor. He was in poor shape but Scrimblo was able to perform basic first aid to ensure he would survive until the morning.

Soon after Scrimblo had begun to make plans to take the wounded man somewhere safer, the party arrived. For a few tense moments each was concerned that the others might be infected but it quickly became clear that they were all still humanoid. Eve recognized the survivor as being Hale of the Icebreaker and immediately set about healing him. Once he was conscious, he recounted the attack, noting that the roc had come from the mountains to the north and presumably nested there.

Having established Hale’s identity, the party immediately turned to Scrimblo. He was reluctant to say much about himself but he mentioned the presence of his hometown of Scrimblo, which was the party’s first indication (aside from Scrimblo himself) that there was still life on disc Zeta. Before they could speak much further, they were interrupted by the arrival of a strange group. They were visibly mutated by the Flesh and eager to evangelize its power. The leader introduced himself as a vessel of purity and hoped to enlighten the adventurers as to the true nature of the Flesh. It quickly became clear that he intended to turn the party into his followers either willingly or forcibly and hostilities quickly broke out.

With Scrimblo’s assistance, the party was able to defeat the cultists and capture their leader. Given that he was not a willing traveler, the party was forced to make the journey back to Hub Zeta on foot rather than teleport back as originally planned, though this was likely safer than expending the magic required to teleport so many people.

Upon their return, Nazena quickly performed a number of abjuration spells that would hopefully render the cult leader’s powers inert within the walls of the hub and ushered Scrimblo inside, eager to speak with him about the state of the disc.
