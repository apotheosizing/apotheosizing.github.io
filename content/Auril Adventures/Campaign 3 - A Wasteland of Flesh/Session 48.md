# Session 48

the gang flies to the mountains, senjana contacts us on our way, she has the wind take us to the true entrance to the center, we go on in, eventually the passage opens up on the other side into a bodily cavity, there are a bunch of facsimilies of people touched by the flesh here, many are constanzes, the constanzes speak, one by one until there are too many of them to make out anything else and then they are silent. the heart beats. constanze appears before us, seeming to be the original constanze, she isn't the happy funny clown we've encountered numerous times, she says this far and no further

we start to fight, she says you know this won't be over even if you destroy this Flesh, from her tome come forth two yugoloths and she engages us personally, once she is defeated, she dissipates, we see a door of bone appear, AIDA asks for divine intervention to long rest us

inside we enter a large open room with three doors further in, the room is weirdly disorienting but we can navigate by the fact that the door behind us is open though our means of entry is gone behind us, we hear some distant sounds of smashing and thrashing, we open a door, and the same room, open another, and again, we hear a BIG loud sound and then a voice says how bold of you to strike here at the heart of things, destroy them flesh of my flesh but scrimblo is not compelled, constanze big face on the other side of the flung open door. the other two door also open to show other faces

scrimblo action surge hastes and destroys both of the eyes on the middle face flesh, from within the face flesh comes a desiccated but kept alive by the Flesh husk of constanze, the core retreats back into the flesh mass after being action surge haste attacked by scrimblo, causing two more eyes to appear on the left and right flesh faces, after popping all the eyes the core reappears and does the bone attack, also scrimblo has been turned into ground flesh by core-stanze, scrimblo is able to break out of it though

scrimblo & luitpold go down but aida uses her second mass heal to get everyone back to full health, one more cycle for a total of three is required to kill it, scrimblo deals the last blow to it, it sucks up our minds to show us what it has seen, we see the nothing between spheres, outside the astral planes, there is a massive body that dwarfs even these planes, it is not only the perfect form but the font of perfection, it takes a mortal wound and each drop of blood spatters across the planes, it seeks to heal by amalgamating with the lost flesh

all the flesh around us is grey and decaying, we make to depart, a dimensional gate opens in front of us and we see seer, it is wretched and decaying, but it hits luitpold with PWK, it turns to the rest of the party and lurches toward us, it says you saw what i saw all those years, you saw my true body, aida says yes, it asks why we put enough of it back together to know what it was missing but not more, did we even think what we were doing, we didn't know, it says that the world is already doomed, rotted through

we depart, it seems some time has passed while we were dissociated, the flesh of the earth is writhing, fort zeta was able to fight it off without difficulty as they'd had a lot of practice fighting off against the Flesh when it rose up with the gate open, the holte estate was destroyed mostly by some people who became gross flesh mutants, scrimblo (town) survived thanks to hiding below + help from the coalition, the bastion's fleshkin escaped but were fled from the meat, agranic was still heavily harmed by their ordeal and had to fight hard and almost destroyed but kijenor hired mercenaries to help them, the forest of the old flesh was able to win safely thanks to embracing their benefits, vitris was great thanks to their cool glass and the prince's city didn't even attack, aetra was fine thanks to them being insane profit-driven freaks

there's a new day dawning on auril, one without the flesh, maybe nature will rebuild from the few places that are left with greenery, AIDA tells the gang that she's going to stay here at the mourning fort to make sure the god's grave lies still, she invites scrimblo to come with her, scrimblo says yes for a time but once things are stable he's going to be retiring, rend dislikes this, scrimblo hands it over to luitpold so that he can find it a new wielder

AIDA and scrimblo head to the mourning fort, cyretta has shifted onto the real ground now and all should be getting back to normal, eve asks luitpold what he's planning to do, luitpold is interested in trying to salvage this world a bit, he has money and logistics, eve offers to make introductions on his behalf with the coalition members, after a few nights in the fort, eve is visited by nimbus in the rooms she shared with the dispersed party, they are back in gnome form, they say it was interesting, and thank the party for saving auril, eve asks if they and the hands knew what the flesh was, nimbus says they did, eve is worried that this is never going to be over, nimbus says things that are connected to it are dying, there may be small pieces left but they'll be rooted out in time

they have one last favour to ask, the seer was right that this world is now empty, things are going to collapse in about two or three months if their calculations are right, when marina exploded herself and prevented new hands of mystral from being made and greater power from being present in auril, but it was contingent on the flesh being there, she's going, but eve could take her place

eve agrees with a month of time to set things in order and tie up loose ends, nimbus then tells eve that if things went badly they would've nuked the planet, eve goes to put her affairs in order, eve comes back alone and when people ask what's up she says she's going off to destroy other flesh across the dimensions which she learned about from luitpold and might not be coming back, sal and nova see through the lie and ask for eve to at least try to find another way, she is willing to do so for their sake though she doubts anything is going to come of it, nothing does so they say goodbye

eve goes to the mesa and the mourning fort right before, she hangs out with them for a few days, then nimbus comes and offers her one last out, she says no, she uses this power to fill the core of the earth with what should be there rather and excavate the bones of the thing rotting inside it

achuak appears as she expends the power and says hey you can leave a little bit of yourself behind, it's nice to feel the wind on your face
