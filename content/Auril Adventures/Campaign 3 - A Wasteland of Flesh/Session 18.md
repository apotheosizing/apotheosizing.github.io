# Session 18

Though unknown means, the archbishop was made aware of the party’s intrusion. He sent a message to AIDA to warn her that their interference in the mines would cost lives but AIDA was in no mood to entertain his self-righteousness and merely responded that the plague would be ended soon.

Maeveiane piloted her home to the aquifer that served as Agranic’s water source. Above the groundwater was a construct of Flesh that the party felt was best dealt with before placing AIDA’s plant in the water. Cutting through the outer wall of Flesh revealed extensive fungal growth within, to the extent that the spores were dense enough that they might be dangerous in the presence of fire. Fortunately, Eva had the light spell.

Following the mycellial network lead to two sentient epicentres - puff-like formations that each promised the party a boon if they were to kill its clone in the other room. The one in the west room offered the knowledge it had gathered while the one in the east room claimed to possess an item that would benefit them. First Eve and then AIDA tried to reason with the creatures to no avail, so the party simply continued on.

A sharp crack and a moaning sound to the north drew the party’s attention deeper into the fungal infection. Along the walls of one area had developed a number of sacs, one of which had ruptured to release a mushroom creature. Once the party dispatched it, it became clear that it had been a humanoid before it fell prey to the fungi.

The explanation for the presence of the mushrooms was found in a nearby laboratory. A discarded clipboard detailed experimental trials on an organism known as the carmine mushroom. Although its infectivity and lethality were considered suitable for the researchers’ purposes, it was too easily spotted and thus eliminated. Its hosts also exhibited a resistance to being controlled by outside forces.

After a few mushroom-related mishaps, the adventurers found a very marked change in scenery as they moved south. Sand covered the Flesh and no living thing - not even the virulent mushrooms - were able to grow near it. Scattered across the next couple of chambers were engraved plinths bearing ornate jars. The jars were each topped with the head of a monstrosity and pictographic text (which Eva was able to translate) warned against disturbing their contents. The party was suitably cautious and avoided interacting with the plinths at all.

One of these rooms, housing a hydra-headed jar, had the corpse of a Constanze who held another clipboard detailing attempts to bend the abilities of a mummy known as Vamir Inadithas to her designs. Although he possessed a number of promising curses, he was none too happy with being unearthed from his tomb and there was little hope of securing his cooperation.

A dust mephit who proclaimed himself to be a servant of Vamir asked the party of a drink, seemingly suffering from some form of heat exhaustion even in the relatively mild temperature. Eve was able to ripen some goodberries for him which earned the party enough goodwill to be told that Vamir could be found further in.

The mummy lord was clearly quite the worse for wear, not even acting to immediately attack the party for being intruders. In fact, Vamir was willing to entertain the party’s presence when they made it clear that they were willing to help him in return. If they retrieved the jars containing his organs he would lean his assistance in dealing with Constanze. Their earlier caution in dealing with the plinths proved wise, as they were able to collect two of the four urns without any particular difficulty due to the curses on them making the thief slow or tired.

The third proved a little difficult by the dust mephit turning violent and attacking, but since he was only a minor elemental he and his allies posed little challenge to the adventurers. Removing the last canopic jar from its plinth activated a complex trap that the party was only able to escape the jaws of by Scrimblo and Eve trading off prying away the stone door to allow one or two escapees at a time. AIDA, who was the last to vacate the area, did so just before the room was engulfed in flame.

Upon their return, Vamir indicated that one of the jars was empty. AIDA was able to spot its true hiding place once she returned to its chamber. The actual jar was conceal by a false panel on its original plinth. The jar containing his heart was nowhere to be found but considering that the party had only explored the western half of the structure, they were certain they would find it elsewhere.

The party took a short rest in Vamir’s room. During this time, Kijenor sent a coded message to Eve via elemental courier by highlighting passages in his contract. The archbishop had invoked clauses that would force him to fight against the party when they next encountered him. Eve was unhappy about the prospect of having to harm her friend but luckily his status as an extraplanar being meant he would not suffer any long-term injuries.

In the southeast wing of the growth, the party found an excess of slime that could only be the end state of the Dripping Rot. A conspicuous metal door in the laboratory proper was sealed by a password but the party was confident they would be able to determine it if they found Constanze’s notes. The certainty of contracting the plague kept most of the party from extensive exploration of the adjoining rooms but AIDA was able to pass through it without concern and Eve, who was already infected, accompanied her. They fought off two black puddings to retrieve another clipboard that listed the project name as “Universal Solvent” - a phrase that matched the number of letters of the password.

Sure enough, the metal door slid open to admit them, revealing a grisly sight. A skeleton, presumably of one of the Constanzes if the horns were any indication, completely dissolved of Flesh by the rot awaited them. She proclaimed that she would soon no longer have to share this world with those who did not deserve it before moving to attack the party who answered her in kind.
