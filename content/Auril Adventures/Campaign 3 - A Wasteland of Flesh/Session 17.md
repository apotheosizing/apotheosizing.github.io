# Session 17

In the initial staging area of the mines, the party was stopped by a small group of guards who questioned what had brought them there. Figuring that honesty was the best policy, they explained that the archbishop had sent them to gather a water sample on behalf of the strangers who’d recently arrived in Agranic, simply leaving out that they were those adventurers. The guards shrugged and let them through.

Owing to the age of the mine, there were a number of abandoned sections that branched off from the main passageway. The party figured that they were unlikely to keep something related to their water supply in a derelict sidepath and followed the track down to the current branch of the mine.

Strangely, a mint had been set up near the entrance, being directly fed by a furnace that smelted down the platinum as it was mined. The furnace seemed to be in poor repair and the people manning it were no better. All of the workers had been chained to their stations to prevent them from attempting to escape.

The party asked the guards where they could find a place to take their sample. One of them explained that there was a pump nearby that kept the seawater from flooding the mine along the northern wall. In this area was a small group of people striking chunks of platinum from large statues that depicted various humanoids. This in itself was concerning so, while Mary worked at getting access to the pump, Eve transformed into a ladybug to explore the areas for which they didn’t have permission. Eva and AIDA, catching on to her intentions, sent their familiars to accompany her.

To the east, the rough stone of the mineshaft changed to a different, smoother material. Clearly delineated chambers held various domestic rooms, including a bedroom, a kitchen, a small painting studio, and a display room for various treasures. All of them had clearly been finely appointed in the past but every item of value, particularly any precious metals, had been looted. Two of the rooms were locked and thus inaccessible to Eve.

She asked Eva to send her a set of thieves’ tools, simply to see if she might be able to bypass the lock despite not being very familiar with their use. In order to distract from Eva’s actions, the rest of the party pretended that they were unable to restart the pump after taking their sample. The guards were not pleased by this development but they believed the lie.

Although Eve was unsuccessful in picking the lock, interacting with it appeared to alert the guards who quickly rushed to search for the intruder. Eve was able to hide in animal form to avoid their sweeps but it was clear that only Eva would be able to open these doors.

Eve returned to the rest of the party and tried her best to stealthily teleport Eva through the locked gate that led to the eastern section of the mine. Unfortunately, the guards noticed the disturbance and violence broke out. AIDA, Mary, and Scrimblo fended off the majority of the guards while Eve transported Eva until eventually she could run the rest of the way.

Deciding to head to the northeast door first, Eva unlocked it to find a gorgon imprisoned there. She was grievously injured and initially frightened by Eva’s appearance, assuming that she was going to force her to use her abilities. It was obvious just how horribly she had been treated by the fact that she attempted to remove her remaining eye in order to prevent this. Eva, uncertain what to do, went back to get her companions.

Meanwhile, all but one of the guards had been taken out. The head guard who held the ring of keys was the only one left and the party asked why he was so adamant about obstructing their exploration of the mine, considering they were trying to cure the plague. Through gritted teeth he admitted to the truth: there was no mine down here. It was only when Eva called them to join her that they realized what he meant.

The party reassured the gorgon that they had no intention of forcing her to do anything she didn’t want to do. She remained hesitant but was not in a position to refuse the party’s help. AIDA retrieved a pair of glasses for her to mitigate her petrifying gaze and handed them over to her, a gesture of tangible goodwill that lead the woman to tell them her name. 

Once she was healed, Maeveiane expressed her gratitude to the party for their help and asked if they had seen a dao or another gorgon - her mothers. Unfortunately, no one had, though the party presumed that the archbishop might have had a hand in preventing them from reaching her. The party asked if she needed any further help from them to get to safety but Maeveiane told them that she would be fine. The stone structure around them was an earthship that could be “flown” underground, though not through the Flesh.

Not wanting to impose but having no other convenient means of freeing the other prisoners in the mine, they asked if she would be willing to allow them to bring the workers aboard. She agreed, though she requested that they stay in the less private rooms of the house. AIDA, thinking of the Lord of Flowers’ words and knowing that gorgons were aligned with the element of earth, asked too if she was familiar with the source of Agranic’s water. Maeveiane was, and she was willing to take the party to it. First, however, everyone would benefit from some time to themselves to rest.
