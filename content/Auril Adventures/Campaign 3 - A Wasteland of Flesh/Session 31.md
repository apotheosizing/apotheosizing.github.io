# Session 31

A closer examination of the city revealed that it was in a state of pandamonium. Devils were both keeping the tide of Flesh at bay and breaking out into smaller-scale fights with each other. Just as the party had absorbed this, the Javelin was forcibly grounded by a spell that was presumably laid down after the incursion of the Flesh. Luckily for the adventurers, they were more than able to walk.

On their path through the heart of the city, the party came up against a number of creatures of the Flesh. A passing orthon lent his assistance and, in return, asked for them to meet his superiors. These turned out to be a pair of imps embroiled in an argument - one of which was Lord Ashur-Shaduni and the other being the imp Asmodeus whom Eve, Mary, and co. had met on the ice.

Ashur-Shaduni explained that he had ended up in his current form as a means of strengthening the university's position in battle with the Flesh. Himself and the imps in Asmodeus' group were bound to reform in a box kept in the city, allowing him to fight without concerns. However, some of the fiends had rallied around a green abishai in a mutiny. Their contracts had been made for the duration of the fight against the Flesh but it had now been twenty years of stalemate with no end in sight. They were increasingly feeling that they would not receive their due payment and thus,they were hoping to at least force a loss to end their contracts prematurely.

The party offered to speak with her in exchange for Ashur-Shaduni's third of the amulet. He agreed and they went out to speak with the mutiny leader. AIDA explained that, while she understood her concerns, the party was intending to destroy the Flesh here and so at most she would only need to wait a couple of days. She agreed to cooperate for 24 hours, after which she expected the issue of the Flesh to be resolved. With this news, the party returned to Ashur-Shaduni. He handed over his piece of the amulet and made a request of the party. Although Henri wanted to preserve the amalgam of students in order to put their souls to rest, Ashur-Shaduni felt that it would be more merciful to simply destroy them.

After a brief detour to retrieve Henri's fragment of the amulet - during which they glimpsed Constanze and the amalgam in the quad that connected the three towers of magic - the party turned their attentions to the Tower of Intellect. It was covered in a strange sheen that they had been told was a sort of time dilation.

Within the tower, night had already (or had previously) fallen and Dr. Vluerona was waiting for the party. She spoke as though she had met the adventurers before but she explained her situation to them. At the moment of the attack on the university, Vluerona cast a spell in an attempt to stop time before anyone came to harm. Over time, it had degraded into a time loop, through which she had lived many, many times, including this moment of explanation.

Her office could be found at the apex of the tower but, in her prior (or future) experience, she and the party would be meeting on the intervening floors several times before they got there. As they had decided to do so before (or would decide to do so), the party stopped off at the second floor to explore.

Each room had a horrifying tableau from the day of the incursion, the students under threat from the Flesh. Most of them the party was unable to save from what had already happened to them. However, the south lounge appeared to be safe, with students chatting and reading. It was only a brief moment of respite, as Vluerona burst into the room just in time to shout a warning to the party before the windows shattered. Thinking fast, AIDA was able to shield the students using a wind wall and no one was harmed. Vluerona wearily thanked her for her help, saying that although she had done this so many times to no effect, she felt that she needed to protect the students as much as she could. Perhaps, one day when the loop broke, it would all be to a purpose.

The party, deeply shaken by their increasing understanding of exactly how awful Vluerona's circumstances were, headed back to the stairs in complete silence. The third floor was not in much better shape, and in fact the majority of the rooms they visited were filled with corpses. The party was able to assist a few students but they knew the consequences of the actions wouldn't hold - the people they helped didn't even seem able to acknowledge their presence. Vluerona was waiting for them in another pocket of calm in the chaos. She remarked with the kind of casualness that only being completely desensitized could offer that they had done well so far, saying that they never arrived in time to save the dead on this floor.

The demoralized party took a small break at the cafe, though it was far from restful. Eve in particular seemed to be struggling with the sheer hopelessness of the situation. Nevertheless, there remained one floor between them and Vluerona's office. The version of her on that floor was at an earlier timepoint and would still remember the password for the wards around her office.

The party had to dispel a few glyphs on their way but they were fortunate to find Vluerona shortly after reaching the floor. She and a number of apprentices had barricaded themselves in one of the rooms, but it was clear that their safety was temporary. Vluerona urged the party to simply go get her piece of the amulet and end this farce forever rather than try to help her here. The party went.

The Vluerona in her office was meeting the party for the first time and she was very startled by a group of people walking in and using her keyword. The last thing that had happened on her personal timeline was the collapse of the quad and she eagerly asked the party if her spell had worked. Their expressions were answer enough for her. They provided an abridged account of what had happened, from their understanding of things, and Vluerona did her best to remain optimistic in the face of the years the party had told her she would have to endure. Before she handed over her part of the amulet, she invited the party to rest in her office, since it sounded like they would all need it.

In no time at all - thanks to the time loop - the party was back in fighting shape, at least on a physical level. They took the elevator back down to the ground floor, where Vluerona was waiting for them. She had nothing else to say to the party, nor they to her. This had gone on long enough; they was nothing else *to* say. With the reconstituted amulet in hand, the party headed out to the quad to confront Constanze.
