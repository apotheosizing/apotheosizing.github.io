# Session 2

Once the prisoner was in custody, the party retired to one of the unused residences within the fort. AIDA took the opprtunity to commune with her god and discern Scrimblo’s intentions. The Lord of Flowers put her concerns to rest and she devoted the remainder of the evening to setting down a word of recall to Fort Zeta.

Early the next morning, the party brought Scrimblo to the ziggurat. Felicity thanked them for their rescue of Hale and extended a formal offer of employment to Scrimblo, who nervously accepted. The commander consulted the party on their plans going forward and they indicated that they would speak to the Flesh cultist before heading north to look for the roc’s nest.

While the rest of the group filed out, Felicity asked Mary to remain behind for a moment. As the rest of the group were little more than strangers to each other, only Eve was concerned by this turn of events. So, in the form of a fly, she returned to eavesdrop on the conversation. Felicity was well-aware of Mary’s reputation and owing to it requested that she act as a contingency against Scrimblo. If he acted to threaten Fort Zeta or any of its people, she had Felicity’s authorization to kill him.

Eve returned to the party shortly before Mary and indicated to Scrimblo that the two of them should talk over what he knew about the appearance of the Flesh on the disc at some later point, mostly as a pretense to speak with him alone. Once they were all present, the party went to interrogate the cultist. He was less than helpful, not willing to discuss much beyond his personal history with his faith. However, he did indicate that those whose eyes were opened by the arrival of the Flesh had been drawn together into loose organization by a leader. This person’s identity and location remained a mystery, though Scrimblo did recall that stories held that the epicenter of the Flesh lay within the cursed woods.

The cultists’ lack of cooperation led naturally into a more grave discussion about what should be done with him. Keeping him contained required considerably resources on Nazena’s part and it was impractical to imprison him indefinitely. On the other hand, he clearly knew more than he had shared with the party and might be the only way for the Coalition forces to learn about the Flesh. The wizard indicated she might be able to make a more permanent magical barrier with sufficient time to research techniques but that would be an entire week during which the fort’s most powerful spellcaster was operating from a weakened position.

A little disheartened, the party turned their attention toward the more easily solved problem of the roc. Eve took Scrimblo aside to speak with him while the rest of the group went to speak with the quartermaster Vola Jomora ahead of the journey. Eve explained what she had overheard in the ziggurat to Scrimblo, who was rightfully frightened by the idea that he might be killed for something he could not control. In response to Eve’s confusion, he recounted the events that led to his unwilling fusion with the Flesh. Though he had no dark designs on the fort, it was possible that his method of fighting would draw suspicion from the party. Eve promised that she would be on Scrimblo’s side if things came to blows.

In order to head off any such scenarios, Scrimblo repeated his tale to the party at large once they were beyond the walls of Zeta. Given his demeanour, the party took the news without judgement. Even Mary was unperturbed, as she had no intention of actually following Felicity’s orders. Now that all was out in the open, the party began their travel north on the winds. A number of curious landmarks were visible from the air, including what appeared to be rows of furrows in the ground reminiscent of a farm and a small village of hibernating werebears. Both bore further investigating but the immanent danger posed by the roc was the priority. Fortunately, with Scrimblo now able to wield the full extent of his abilities without fear of his companions’ reactions, they made short work of the creature.
