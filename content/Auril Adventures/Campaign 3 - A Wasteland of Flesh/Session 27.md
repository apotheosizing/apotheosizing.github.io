# Session 27

Bertram drew upon the power of his ancestor, changing himself into a hawk to avoid AIDA’s ability to summon sunlight and keep the party at arm’s length. Unfortunately for him, he picked up Scrimblo in his claws with the intention of letting gravity do its work. Scrimblo, tenacious as ever, held on by a hair’s breadth and was able to ground Bertram, forcing him to confront them directly.

For his last stand against the party, he transmuted himself into light and fought with the radiance of the Shackled Star, but it was all for naught. As Bertram was reduced to ash, he swore that he would return - for it took only one drop of blood to restore him to power. At this, a number of the people of the estate were able to push through the guards who had been keeping them back from the battleground with the clear intention to do just that. Needing to suddenly make their escape from the surging hostile crowd, Eve gathered up the ashes in the body of the air elemental she had summoned during the fight and cast wind walk.

The party’s immediate inclination was to flee the Holte lands entirely but they worried that leaving the Shackled Star alive without Bertram keeping it in check could lead to disastrous consequences. Due to the mood of the people, taking the opportunity to recuperate before the confrontation seemed unwise so the four slipped into the castle and barricaded themselves inside as best they could.

Once safely behind the doors of the castle, the party transferred Bertram’s ashes to the bag of holding as a temporary measure. Presumably as a consequence of its master’s death, a strange fog had filled the halls. Light pouring down from the prison of the Shackled Star made navigating it difficult and Scrimblo shortly found himself separated from the group.

He was confronted by a being of light that sought to bar his way. By the time Eve and AIDA had tracked him down, he had defeated it, but as they had no idea how many of these beings were present in the castle, they quickly returned to the path to the Star.

As they climbed toward the highest level of the castle, afterimages of the light in the fog impressed themselves on the party’s mind. Each was a promise from the Star, offering purity and power to the adventurers in a way befitting their fears and desires. Eve hesitated. She made one last appeal to AIDA - the most militant enemy of the parasite - suggesting that they might be able to turn it to a useful purpose. AIDA was not convinced by this line of argument and, though Eve let the matter go, it was obvious that she was not content with this.

The many traps and locked doors AIDA and Scrimblo had encountered during their first visit to the sun’s prison had all been burned away, leaving them a clear path to the Star. Its shackles had been shaken loose in a desperate bid to preserve its life and incarnated into humanoid forms, one of which had been the creature that fought Scrimblo on the main floor.

Without Bertram’s relationship or a god for it to draw from, the Star was decaying. This did not, however, make it any less of an active threat. The Star immediately began to make direct offers to the party. It tried first with Mary, who was in close quarters to it in an attempt to extract the blood the three traitors required. She did not entertain its words.

Scrimblo, meanwhile, having realized that the shackle that had attacked him must have simply wanted to keep people away from the Star in order to starve it out, explained that party’s goals to the shackles. Though they could not harm the Star directly they agreed not to attack the party. Unfortunately, it was at this point that the Star spoke to Eve.

It promised her the ability not only to keep those she knew from death but to revive all those she’d lost along the way. Eve accepted. The Shackled Star needed only to be freed from its bonds and all would be hers. When Eve continued to attack the shackles even after Scrimblo arranged their ceasefire, it quickly became apparent what was going on.

Eve was not an especially effective fighter but with both Athena and a conjured elemental she was able to deal reasonable harm to the shackles. The rest of the party was now fighting not only to destroy the Star before it could kill them, they were trying to keep the shackles intact.

The situation grew increasingly dire, even with AIDA using the skull she had recovered from the western fort to call forth the fallen warriors of the past. Two of the four shackles remained, with those rapidly being worn down. AIDA and Mary tried to convince Eve to abandon her plan to no avail. Scrimblo, seeing no other option, attacked her, but the Star simply healed her when he knocked her out.

As the Star decomposed further, it became more dangerous. It seared Mary’s eyes from her skull, forcing her to rely on the tremorsense she’d gained from the parasite. AIDA tried to evacuate the party with the intention of allowing it to simply crumble into nothing but the Star made it clear that the grieved people of the estate would be easily manipulated into temporary hosts.

Needing to preserve the shackles and bring things to a close before the encroaching mob reached them, Scrimblo changed his tactics. Rather than attacking Eve, he turned his sword on Athena, saying that either Eve could stop or he would kill Athena and then Mary. Eve, *so close* to destroying the shackles and rendering the very idea of the death of her companions impotent,, ignored him. One damaged shackle was all that was keeping the Star captive.

Scrimblo, completely desperate at this point, followed through on his threat, decapitating Athena. The rest of the party was stunned and Scrimblo began to make his way to Mary. At this point, the Star was on its last legs and opted to use the very last of its essence in an attempt to vaporize the party in an act of pure fury. This ultimate blast of holy light and fire knocked AIDA out, leaving only an injured Mary and Scrimblo standing.

Eve, who had heard the last words of the Star questioning the intentions of her friends if they were willing to hurt her like this, immediately fled on the wind with Athena’s remains. Scrimblo was able to find a few potions on AIDA person to bring her back to consciousness before breaking down in the aftermath of what he’d had to do. Mary, who was completely shell-shocked by Eve’s betrayal, parted ways with Scrimblo and AIDA in the hope of finding Eve in her usual place at the werebear village.

Skald was initially delighted to finally meet one of the people Eve had told him about but quickly grew concerned when he absorbed Mary’s physical and emotional state. He sent her off to the care of someone in the village while he confirmed that she wasn’t with his counterparts elsewhere on the disc.

Meanwhile, AIDA did her best to comfort Scrimblo and pull herself together enough to speak to the expectant heirs to the estate who awaited them at the foot of the castle. AIDA warily explained that Mary had only been able to gather two vials worth of blood from the Star before the battle had completely fallen apart, but this was no issue for the Holtes. Two of them nonchalantly tore apart one of their siblings before graciously accepting the blood of their progenitor and sweeping into their new home.

Not being remotely in a state to address this, AIDA recalled herself and Scrimblo to the fort. She informed Mary of where they were so she could return to them after the wind walk spell wore off and tried to contact Eve. Her message arrived but received no response. Both she and Scrimblo were so exhausted that they quickly collapsed into bed as soon as they could reach them. The fallout would have wait.
