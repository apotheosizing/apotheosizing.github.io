# Session 9

While Jeremiah worked to mend the circlet, AIDA questioned him about the fate of the apprentices who had accompanied him on the Icebreaker. As far as he was aware, one of them survived the fall to Eoril, though it had been many years since the incident and there was no guarantee that they still lived.

With his circlet on his head, Jeremiah was able to take his draconic form. Errol gave the old man his blessing and allowed the party to take him to Fort Zeta. It was swiftly decided that the party should check on the fort where AIDA had intervened on their return course.

The fort was subdued, with minimal activity on the walls. The Lord of Flowers confirmed that the soldiers stationed there were safe but could not leave, a cryptic statement whose meaning was not immediately evident. However, the party did not have time to ponder it as another wave of Flesh was cresting over the horizon.

The watch bells rang and the soldiers sprung into action, utterly ignoring the descent of the adventurers. Interactions with the soldiers were of a strange character, with most of them seeming distracted during conversations and forgetting the presence of the party moments after speaking to them. With the Lord of Flowers’ words in mind, the adventurers began to wonder if the soldiers were trapped in a cyclical timeloop or were ghosts.

Though the conversation was slow, the commander of the troops beseeched the party to find the captain, claiming that he would know what to do. Eve and Eva remained on the main wall to assist in repelling the Flesh while Scrimblo, Mary, and AIDA searched the buildings within the fort for the captain.

During their explorations, Scrimblo’s heightened senses alerted him to an unseen presence on the grounds. Eva was able to cast a spell to reveal that several creatures of the Flesh were in stasis at various points in the main courtyard. They did not react to any stimuli but Scrimblo remained behind to keep an eye on them.

Mary and AIDA went to the eastern barracks, where they found a trapdoor. Expanded barracks and a small prison were housed here but the real area of interest was a room found through a hidden door to the north where a lone man was sitting, holding a flower - a lily, symbolic of death.

The man, Captain Azritam, explained the nature of the Lord of Flowers’ miracle, He revealed to Azritam that he and his forces had been repeating the moments leading up to their deaths when the Flesh first invaded the disc for years. AIDA knelt down with him and offered him words of comfort, promising that their eternal rest would be awaiting them.

Azritam finally accepted his fate, causing himself and the other ghosts to dissipate. In seconds, the fort reverted to its true state, a decrepit ruin twisted by the Flesh and the creatures that infested it sprung to life. The adventurers were able to fight off the creatures and reunite in the courtyard, where AIDA explained what had occurred with Azritam. Eve was horrified by the idea of letting the soldiers remain dead, but her companions insisted that it would be cruel to call them back from their well-deserved rest. On their way out, AIDA inscribed an epitaph for the dead on the face of the fort.

Back at Fort Zeta, a general air of excitement was in the air at the recovery of the legendary Jeremiah Manswell. In a meeting with Felicity, Jeremiah outlined his plans. He would return to Auril to set his affairs in order before travelling back to Zeta with the intention of studying the eternal storm at the edge of the disc. Felicity agreed to facilitate this, though not until the gate would normally be opened for the next scheduled delivery of supplies and forces from the Coalition.

Some of those who had been brought to the fort recently were learning about the operation of the gates. Both AIDA and Eva listened to her explanation to ensure that, if worse came to worst, they would be able to use them. Eva intercepted Nazena after she was done with the lesson with the intention of testing the effectiveness of the parasites on the priest of Purity.

Eva made one last attempt to extract information from the priest with conventional interrogation tactics to no avail. With Nazena’s assent, she forcibly implanted a parasite into the priest, who triggered a mechanism to melt his own flesh from his bones to escape the desecration of his form.

Meanwhile, Eve visited the werebear village to discuss recent events with Skald. He offered her some much needed perspective and the same warm conversation and community as her last visit. For the second time since she left the hamlet, Eve felt at home and at ease.
