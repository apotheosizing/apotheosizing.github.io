# Session 26

Across the hall, the party found a dining hall decorated with bones. A silver chalice with three indents stood out among the yellow-white and prompted AIDA to recall seeing a number of gems scattered throughout the previous level of the crypt. One topped a decanter of wine that the gelatinous cube had been engulfing, one was the centerpiece of a dog collar laid with its wearer in the upper niches, and one remained undiscovered. Further searching led the party back to the wine cellar, where they found one inside the punctured cask Eve had resealed.

With all three gems in hand, a number of skeletons formed out of the scattered bones to prevent the party from reconstituting the chalice. They were able to fight them off only to learn that the chalice did nothing more than release a blast of necrotic energy.

Keeping this lesson in mind, the party sidestepped a room of entombed vampire hunters and continued deeper into the crypt. An abattoir filled with the corpses of those fed to the vampires in the far south had a black sword at its center. An inscription declared it to be the sword Eternity. Mary was able to pry it out of the calcified fingers holding it only to have it drop into a pit - another trap. However, she was quick enough to be able to catch it with a mage hand and retrieve it. Since it existed only to lure graverobbers to their deaths, it was entirely blunt, but its obsidian construction still made it a reasonable bludgeon.

Before entering the burial chambers of Bertram’s remaining family, the party circled back to the only door they hadn’t opened. Within, they found a zombie who introduced himself as the groundskeeper. Mr Asp indicated that he was overjoyed that someone had come to destroy the traitor lords but, when AIDA indicated that they would be killing Bertram too, he alerted the vampires below that the party was on their way. Mary killed him shortly after but the damage was already done.

As the vampires would be forewarned, the party opted to take an hour to rest before going to confront them. During their rest, AIDA heard the sound of numerous footsteps far above the crypt but the party was not attacked.

The vampire Etiona Holte calmly greeted the party as they entered the last burial chamber of the crypt. She explained that herself and her siblings had called all the lesser vampires at their disposal to their aid and so fighting them would be fruitless. She went on to make her appeal, explaining that unlike Bertram they had adapted to the changed world. Their subsistence on the Flesh meant that they posed no danger to the estate if left alone.

AIDA, who was willing to entertain them as possible allies, asked what their attitude was toward the parasite that Bertram was intent on protecting. As the progenitor of their line, they would require a small portion of its blood to restore their power and become true scions of the Holte line but, that aside, they were willing to allow AIDA to destroy it as she wished when they were done. They were even willing to allow the party to remove most of the Flesh from the disc, so long as they left its original territory within the Marrow Wood untouched.

Given that the complete destruction of the Flesh seemed unlikely, the party was willing to let the vampires act as a means of keeping whatever remained under control. They agreed to an alliance with the vampires and, in exchange, were told all they knew of Bertram’s weaknesses.

Since they could not confront Holte until the batteries in Vitris were complete, the party returned to the fort to check in with Commander Jomora. Even with a carefully redacted report from AIDA, she was greatly impressed by the party’s continual progress, particularly in light of the spectacular failures of her predecessor to push back against the Flesh. She told them that she had recently put in a requisition for another airship but Coalition construction efforts were primarily focused on projects on other discs.

Having some time to kill, the party spent their time in and around the fort, with the exception of Eve who visited Skald and his counterparts in the Hell’s Reach and God’s Grave mountains for the majority of her free time. Mary and Scrimblo devoted all of their time to training in the use of firearms with the Coalition forces - though Mary took a quick detour to obtain another parasite from Lousy Lou. AIDA travelled to Scrimblo (town) to do some research on the various landmarks they had not yet visited. Little was known of Cardia even before the Flesh had escaped its confines but she was able to learn something of Elbarai and the strange magic bubble the party had seen in their travels.

A city called Cyretta used to occupy the place now covered by the bubble. It had been host to an eccentic wizard, formerly of Elbarai, who had been studying inter-disc teleportation. Elbarai itself had been the former magical center of the disc but no one had heard from the city since the major settlements across Zeta had sent messengers asking them for help when the Flesh began to cover the disc.

The Javelin returned to the fort after three weeks time to retrieve the party and then set out for the estate. It had mostly recovered from Anne Lupine’s ill-conceived attack by then and Holte was at leisure to meet with them personally. Eve made one last appeal to him to relinquish the star but Holte was, it seemed, at the end of his patience with outsiders dictating his rule over the estate. AIDA, who was impatient to destroy the parasite, attempted to goad Holte into attacking by exposing the truth of the Shackled Star to the people of the estate. Although one of the conditions of Holte’s vampirism bound him to courtesy, AIDA had broken the law of hospitality first, allowing him to finally do what he had wanted to since they first confronted him about the star: put them in their place.
