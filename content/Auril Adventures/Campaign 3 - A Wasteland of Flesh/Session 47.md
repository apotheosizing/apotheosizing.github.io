# Session 47

Once the principle resources had been identified and gathered, the party and the leadership of Vitris began formulating the city's defence strategy. Using a mirage arcane at the centre of the field of engagement they could force the approaching army to split its forces in two, necessitating two battlefronts but preventing the Prince's City to overwhelm them with an united offence. Before they could hammer out the finer points of the gambit, the discussion was interrupted by the appearance of a weft in the fabric of reality. Through this tear came a person in a strange atmospherically-insulated suit accompanied by a talking skull.

He - after being told by his companion that the air was breathable - removed his helmet and asked the assembled whether the planet was being menaced by Flesh. The disoriented party asked why he knew of the Flesh, given that he was clearly some manner of dimensional traveler with no prior knowledge of Auril, and was disheartened to learn that every place he had visited across the vastness of the firmament had been infected by the Flesh. Not one of these other lands had survived conflict with it.

Nevertheless, he had extensive experience with the Flesh and thus offered to lend his aid to the party. He introduced himself as Luitpold Dietrich and revealed that he had become quite rich in his travels, meaning he could finance a number of the more expensive means of warfare that were previously out of reach.

Thus when the forces of the Prince's City marched to take the city Vitris was ready. After two weeks of fierce combat it became clear how the tide of battle was turning when an envoy from the humanoid conscripts of the oasis town beneath the Prince's City arrived to offer their surrender and, in fact, their forces to Vitris. Eve and Scrimblo were willing to accept their terms but Luitpold deduced that their offer was disingenuous and demanded the truth. The envoy acquiesced, revising their statement to ask simply for passage through the city as they fled from the City. This, too, turned out to be a falsehood: Luitpold realised that they sought to smuggle a weapon into the city and ordered them executed and their wagons searched, indeed producing an explosive device.

Seeing that the ruse had failed, the City sent forth their commander, the Prince's lich Lyari Halis. The party knew very well that he was a credible threat but Scrimblo and his recruits were able to occupy him while the rest of the army destroyed two of the three illusory oasis outposts which provided reinforcements.

Yet even in their supremacy, the backline combatants found themselves under attack from the south. The Seer, who had been made the party's enemy by Eve, had arrived with legions of the Flesh. Vitris' guards would not last long against them but, fortauntely, with only one remaining garrison from the front to contend with, the advancing army of Vitris was able to refocus their efforts on the lich and destroy his physical manifestation once more.

With their leader defeated both the mummies of the City and their conscripts scattered. The Seer and its subordinate Flesh had lost their moment and so followed suit, retreating back into the wasteland of Flesh with a sneer. Vitris had defended itself from its enemies once more and Yahg remarked that he doubted the Prince's pride would allow him to risk a third defeat at their hands, affording Vitris a likely period of continued safety until at least the end of the current Prince's reign.

Although the city of Vitris celebrated that night, the party still had a grim task ahead; the God's Grave Mountains, the origin of Auril's infection, awaited them.
