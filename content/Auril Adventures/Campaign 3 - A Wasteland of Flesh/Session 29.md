# Session 29

Just as the Javelin took flight, a number of flying creatures of the Flesh appeared to attack the party and deliver a message from Constanze. With each monster they destroyed, a word floated up from its corpse, forming a reminder that the Flesh was their enemy. The party wondered amongst themselves why exactly Constanze was so hellbent on changing their minds but their decision to assist the Seer was not reconsidered.

Vitris had begun its recovery from the conflict with the Prince's city but it was evident that the city would not make a full recovery for several weeks to come. Yahg, however, welcomed the adventurers in good spirits and was especially curious about their idea to create a body for the Seer. The Flesh suits held no consciousnesses so, while he did not think the construction of the vessel would pose much difficulty to him with AIDA's schematics as a guide, the party would need to deal with the matter of allowing the Seer to inhabit it. Eve figured that she might be able to adapt the reincarnate spell to serve that purpose.

Rather than waiting for him to construct a new suit from scratch, Yahg recommended that the party retrieve the unit of rogue suits that had been lost during the earlier battle. Locating the suits proved challenging, since scrying on the suits did not reveal much in the way of identifying landmarks. Still, in cloud form the group could travel the entire span of the desert in about two days.

Fortunately for them, the party spotted the suits on a small outcropping of rock - one of the few places in the Obsidian Desert where the Flesh could take root. Three of the four suits had broken down into flowering growths but one remained mostly intact. They focused their attacks on disabling the useable suit before dispatching the Flesh flowers.

Once the danger had passed, the party was able to explore the ruins of whatever had once rested on the stone. Time and merciless winds had worn down the surrounding buildings to little more than rubble but a small staircase led down to a tomb which had been protected from the elements. A warning at its entrance said that misfortune would befall any who stole the rightful belongings of its occupant. Mary, naturally, quickly went about taking everything that wasn't nailed down.

The Flesh suit initially presented a small wrinkle in the party's return to Vitris that was solved by a quick teleportation to the Javelin.  Yahg, who had now had the opportunity to look over AIDA's schematics, informed them that he would need one last thing to complete the modifications to the suit: meteor steel needles. The Meteor Forge was close enough by wind walk to be a possible source, particularly as Eve and Eva had made contact with the fire giants once before, but Yahg knew of another option. A woman named Ziore possessed a set of needles which she used for tattooing. Although she lived alone in the desert, she had maintained friendly relations with the city and would likely be willing to let Yahg borrow the needles.

Indeed, Ziore would allow the party the use of her needles in exchange for a small favour. A small gang of berserkers had recently chased her away from the source of one of her dyes because they wanted to use them as a recreational drug. The patch of adrenaline glands in contention could be found not far from her home.

As no violence had come to pass between Ziore and the adrenaline junkies, the party attempted to resolve things peacefully when they reached the patch. The berserkers were not inclined to listen to them, particularly when it quickly became clear they had little idea how to provide them with their own source of the glands. Between knocking them out and Eve forcibly detoxing them to talk them down, the junkies eventually surrendered and allowed themselves to be taken to Vitris. There, the party promised, the city's knowledge of the Flesh could be used to cultivate the adrenaline they were after.

Another short jaunt to Ziore's home got them the needles, which they gave over to Yahg. A mere few hours later, he declared the vessel complete.
