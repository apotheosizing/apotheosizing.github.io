# Session 40

Upon its arrival, the party briefly fought the astral dreadnought before diving into its internal demiplane to retrieve the ritual components. Within Jappe's basement one of the other devoured creatures now infesting it - a cloaker - accosted them. However, it was not hostile, and thus they were able to exchange some diamonds with it for the ritual items it had taken from the chest in which they had been kept, and even some of the other things it had scavenged across the planes. Then AIDA teleported the party back to the wizard's tower.

Jappe consulted the party on where exactly he might return the town of Cyretta, given that the lands where it previously was located had been overtaken by the Flesh. AIDA suggested the area surrounding the fort in the God's Grave Mountains purified by the Lord of Flowers. He had no objection to the idea and began preparing the ritual. In a week, Cyretta should be restored to the material plane.

With the matter resolved, AIDA planeshifted the party back to Fort Zeta. From there, they planned to set out for the city of Aetra, but they were forestalled when they noticed a new influx of nonmilitary personnel at the fort. Their inquiries revealed that the assistance of the spellcasters of Elbarai had allowed Nazena to craft an antimagic shell around the fort to prevent the teleportation mechanism from drawing the ire of the Flesh. As it was no longer dangerous to do so, people and goods had been flowing into the fort for several days now.

They learned, too, that Commander Jomora had gathered the heads of the disc's various communities to ensure that there was a contingency in the event the party's decisive blow against the Flesh were to fail. The party made a brief visit during which Yahg, who was in attendance as Vitris' representative, indicated that the looming threat of the Prince's City still cast a shadow over the City of Glass.

Figuring that they might benefit from the aid of Aetra in protecting Vitris, they departed for the last prosperous city on the disc. On the way, Scrimblo shared what he knew about Aetra. The city was highly partisan and controlled only nominally by its head of state. In actuality, the consortium of guilds was the true power in Aetra.

When the party arrived in Aetra, they landed in the Graveyard of the Undying. This quarter of the city was filled with the spirits of those buried there, kept tethered by some arcane operation to allow them to share their wisdom with those who visited. Among these ghosts was a black dragon named Deirdre who had served as the city's mayor for many decades.

She was delighted to see new faces in the city - the party's status as outsiders was obvious in their lack of badges to mark their affiliation with a guild. Scrimblo had heard that those who were not members of a guild were considered to have no rights under the law and Deirdre made it clear that attitude had not changed in the years of the city's isolation. AIDA asked her about Aetra's readiness to deal with the mountain of Flesh that had been seen slowly moving toward the city, which they had seen on their flight, and if they had encountered Constanze.

Constanze, in fact, was lingering in the dragon's mausoleum herself and chose that moment to reveal herself. Interestingly, she had made the same offer to deal with the mountain herself. She explained that the mountain was not under her control, though she would not divulge whether it had developed separate consciousness from the Flesh or if it was another entity like the Old Flesh. Regardless, the city had refused the offer, as the creatures that came down from the mountain provided a steady stream of work for Aetra's various guilds.

The party considered this. They might be able to convince the guilds to allow them to help them by contracting them for both the defence of Vitris and the final battle against the Flesh, which would presumably more than make up for the lost work that would follow from neutralizing the mountain. Deirdre, though not particularly convinced that this would work, informed them that they would need to convene the guild consortium to make their offer. Any of the heads of the various guilds had the authority to call a meeting but without any affiliation with a guild, they would likely not be given the time of day.

The party headed back out into the city with the intent to lean on AIDA's formal position as an angel in order to consult one of the clerical guilds. However, Mary indicated that she had other errands in the city. Rend's creator - a member of the Artificer's Guild named Alto - was close at hand and the weapon was insistent that she deal with him immediately. After a brief argument with Eve, Mary slipped off into the city alone with the promise that she would meet back up with the rest of the party once the deed was done.

In order to blend in with the crowd, Mary lifted a guild emblem from a passerby and let Rend lead her to Alto's house. He was an elderly man who lived alone, meaning that Mary was able to infiltrate his home without raising the alarm. Alto was caught utterly unawares and so, despite his prodigious skill, was not able to defend himself from Mary. He seemed in his last moments to recognize Rend even in its new form and tried to say something to Mary, though whether it was a warning or a plea she would never know.

Still Rend was not yet satisfied. It told Mary that she must find a small silver hammer, the only tool that could unmake it, and destroy it. It required some searching but Mary was able to locate the hammer and she took it with her as she departed the house, telling Rend that she would neutralize the hammer the following morning.

Meanwhile, the rest of the party - after a brief, failed diversion to the consortium meetinghouse in the hopes they might gain entry as customers - reached the temple of the clerics to the nature gods. With a generous donation of diamonds and the invocation of AIDA's full designation, they were granted a much more tolerant audience than they had received from any other figure in the city.

The head of the guild was more than happy to call a meeting of, at the very least, the other clerical guilds in the consortium but lamented rather pointedly that it would take some time. AIDA supplied a more fulsome bribe and he agreed to summon them for a meeting that very day, though he would require a few hours to speak to all the necessary people. As they had the time to spend, the party decided that it would be best put to the purpose of gathering additional information about the city that might aid them in the forthcoming negotiation.
