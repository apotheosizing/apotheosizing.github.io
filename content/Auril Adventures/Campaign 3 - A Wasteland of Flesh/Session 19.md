# Session 19

Being little more than runoff from the pulsating organ that originated the plague, the party was able to eliminate the ooze animating the bones of Constanze. AIDA placed the sapling she had been given by the Lord of Flowers at the site from which the Dripping Rot flowed and, with a quick prayer, broke the unnatural magic of it.

AIDA quickly contacted Bishop Vadrung with the news, emphasizing that the passage of immediate danger for the people of Agranic meant that the bill would come due for his unconscionable behaviour. She overtly threatened him if he were to do anything to prevent the party from leaving.

The bishop did not so much as thank the adventurers for their aid, instead telling AIDA that he had waylaid the crew of the Javelin and demanded that they meet him to discuss terms of a ceasefire. After setting up a spell to allow them to return to help Vamir when the matter of the archbishop was resolved, the party prevailed upon Maeveiane to take them aboveground.

Vadrung, accompanied by a number of warriors and an angel of Waukeen, insisted that the party repay him for the loss of Maeveiane. His dismissive reaction to being confronted by the fact that he had enslaved a sentient being immediately broke down negotiations into a battle. He initially succeeded in preserving his life by warning Eva that the deal allowing the clerics to perform resurrections with platinum was dependent on him but unfortunately Eve - who had primarily been engaged with Kijenor until an opening to finish the bishop presented itself - did not hear his warning.

When the battle was won, the party turned their attention to curing as many living sufferers of the plague as possible until they could negotiate a new contract with Waukeen. AIDA, Eva, and Scrimblo went to speak with the king while Mary and Eve headed to the temple to speak with Millicent.

AIDA’s conversation with the king was brief and disappointing. It had been evident that Vadrung was the true power in the kingdom and the king’s spineless reaction to being confronted by what was done to Maeveiane only made it more so: he burst into tears and said that there was no other option before fleeing the castle entirely. Millicent was a much more effective leader, as she rounded up and dispatched the clerics to perform as many restorations as possible with their remaining magic.

Even with every person possessed of healing magic working to cure the Dripping Rot, there were nowhere near enough to get to everyone that day. A number of the people who could not be tended to became agitated, forming the beginnings of a mob of desperate people seeking help. Mary was able to intervene before things turned violent but it was clear the party would need to work quickly over the next several days to avoid further deaths.

Until Waukeen saw fit to grace them with her notice, the city of Agranic would have to turn to mundane means of disease control. AIDA and Eve were able to identify, magically grow, and collect a number of medicinal herbs that could be used to create a herbal concoction that would combat the infection. With the help of the clerics and the rest of the party, they were able to disseminate the information and ingredients to the general population, allowing them to treat the Rot at home.

All that remained was the matter of the dead. Eve was able to raise a few of those closest to the cutoff point for the spell raise dead but a new deal with Waukeen was their best hope. The angel who Vadrung had summoned returned to Agranic a day later. She introduced herself as Sepharial and laid out the demands of the goddess.

A diamond of incomparable value was in the possession of a man known as the Distant Prince of a walking city on the Obsidian Desert. Waukeen would reinstate the previous agreement with the bishop in exchange for the promise of the diamond’s retrieval within three months’ time. If the party failed to deliver the diamond, three of their souls would be taken as collateral. Having no other way to revive the dead in Agranic before their souls became too distant for most magic and little effective bargaining power against Waukeen, the party agreed to these terms.

Before Sepharial returned to the celestial realm, she took AIDA aside. Throughout the meeting, she had referred to her as “sister” and, noting AIDA’s confusion, explained why. AIDA had been constructed to as a vessel for and a medium for understanding the power of the gods. What was an angel, if not a being created by a deity to accomplish those twin ends? Sepharial further offered to lend an ear if AIDA ever needed consultation on divine matters, though she was reluctant to speak about the forgotten god the chained angel of the Holt estate when AIDA took her up on it.

Now that they had a spare moment, AIDA contacted Hale to ensure the crew of the Javelin was safe. They had been marooned on the nearby sea with a punctured balloon by Vadrung but were nearly back at the shore now. One member of the crew had been killed in the struggle but Eve was able to return them to life.

As Vamir was once a denizen of the Obsidian Desert, they had more than compassion as incentive to assist the mummy in regaining his heart. AIDA returned them to the depths of the aquifer and the party spent some time considering where they should search for it. Vamir’s conjecture was that the heart would be kept in the vicinity of his person. Combing through the adjacent rooms, AIDA spotted a lockbox that required input of a code.

A matrix of small circles covered its surface and each could be filled with the face of one of several creatures. Using the heads decorating the canopic jars and the knowledge of which organ they contained, the party placed the corresponding creature as though the matrix was a humanoid body. This opened the box - all that remained was to bring it to Vamir.
