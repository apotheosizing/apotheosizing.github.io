# Session 15

In an effort to further narrow down possible alternatives to the use of the sun, AIDA asked if the answer might be found in the library at Scrimblo. The Lord of Flowers indicated that it could but it may not be immediately apparent. Her last question was whether they were looking for an animate or inanimate thing and the Lord of Flowers said there were a number of potential solutions to their problem.

Before departing for Scrimblo, the party would need to resolve the matter of Anne Lupine, who was expecting a report from AIDA. AIDA informed Anne that her reconnaissance was complete. Anne invited AIDA - and extended her invitation to the rest of the party - to meet her in Revat at a bar called the Happy Allium. The password they would need was “garlic wine”.

As Bertram had summarily dismissed them, the party made for Revat immediately. From an airborne approach it was obvious that Revat had once been a trade hub, with a number of large, still-maintained roads leading out beyond the barrier. The Happy Allium itself likewise enjoyed reasonable patronage, though no one noticed the five adventurers led down into the basement to speak with the leader of the revolt.

Trading on her connection to the Subnetwork, Eva took point in the conversation with Anne. She was not particularly impressed by their inability to find the treasure she sought but she saw no reason to oppose their desire to do further research into Holte outside his domain. She had her own ends to work toward.

Eve received a sending from Jeremiah on the flight to Scrimblo. Back at Zeta, the portal was being opened for resupply, allowing him to return to set his affairs in order. Since their scouring of the lower levels the city had begun to thrive again. A number of venues were open again and the mood among the residents was jovial. The library indicated two great sources of elemental power on Eoril: the eternal storm that the kobolds on the mesa worshipped and a volcano centered on a planar tear into the Plane of Fire near Agranic. Of the two, the volcano was the closer destination so the group decided to pay it a visit to confirm that no one held it in especial esteem.

Exploring an active volcano was a dangerous prospect for even adventurers of their caliber. As such, Eve summoned a fire elemental to do some preliminary scouting around and inside the caldera. It reported the presence of a few fire giants living on the mountainous regions of the volcano but nothing that posed an immediate threat. However, it was unable to examine the planar fissure. AIDA, who could magically fortify herself against the heat, volunteered to plumb deeper. The party had few other options and this agreed, though Eva gave her one further ward before she left.

Within the volcano, AIDA encountered a pair of fire giants, only one of whom could speak with her. She and a friend of hers had come by boat from the community around the volcano to study the portal. The date of its appearance was unknown but the woman theorized that the City of Brass on the other side of the portal might have records of it. Although both AIDA and Eve could cast plane shift, they would require a fork attuned to the destination plane in order to facilitate travel. Until they could find one, they would simply have to consider the rift from their own side.

Rather than returning to the Holte Estate, the party opted to visit Agranic. It was only about an hour’s travel by airship and it, like the Holte lands, was free of the influence of the Flesh. They supposed that they might be able to use or incorporate whatever method kept Agranic safe in their plans for the Holte Estate.

However, it was obvious that the city was far from idyllic. The residents all moved in a strange lethargy and wore full body suits that seemed to conflict with the heat. A contingent of guards intercepted the party the moment the Javelin set down. If they entered the city they would be unable to leave as Agranic was suffering from a highly contagious plague. Their warning did not deter the party, instead making them want to stay to help combat the plague.

The streets were filled with guards wielding clockwork lances and doctors collecting the dead for revival at the temple. Although the lack of loss of life was a good thing, this concerned Eve and AIDA as it indicated that the disease would propagate among the population without any firebreak.

While aiding the healers at the temple, the party gleaned what they could about the nature of the plague. Due to its lethality, there had not been the opportunity to devote resources to studying it in depth, but the Dripping Rot had three distinct stages. The first was the lethargy that they had seen among the townspeople. It progressed into weeping sores and finally into melting flesh. The use of lesser restoration or other means of healing were able to reverse its progress, but not cure it, and death did not end it either. Naturally-occurring magical diseases were exceedingly rare and so this affliction of the soul was likely rooted in some type of necromantic spell.

According to some of the clerics, the bishop might be able to shed further light on the Rot but he was occupied by guarding the king against infection. He and one other individual in the city had not been stricken with the disease. The party asked who the other was and were brought to the workshop of the artisan making the lances they had seen earlier - Kijenor. Eve was elated to see her old friend but it was obvious why Kijenor was unaffected by the Rot, having no soul and being immune to all forms of toxins. Kijenor had returned to making fiendish deals of late, hence his presence in Agranic, and his was not the only bargain the king had made in the hopes of solving the plague; Waukeen’s clergy were the leaders of the efforts to keep death at bay.

An audience with the king was in order but only AIDA would be allowed in his presence due to her lack of ability to carry disease. Alone, she met with the bishop and the king in the walls of the palace and formally offered the party’s help. The bishop gave what information he could, claiming that the illness was a curse from a vengeful god furious that Agranic had escaped the clutches of the Flesh. The king remained silent, looking uncomfortable.

AIDA, picking up on the weak link, asked the king directly if they had angered any other powerful forces that might wish harm on the city. It was obvious that they had and the bishop relented enough to admit that the city had recently offended a powerful spellcaster by refusing to pay her for her services but no further. Sensing that she would get no straight answers from them, AIDA left, swearing that the party would save Agranic from their mistakes.
