# Session 25

The soldier leading the unit sent by the Coalition drew the party aside to deliver a message from Commander Jomora. Communication from Marastar had been delivered since their last visit, including instructions from the higher-ups in the Coalition that demanded more material progress on the disc in the form of another foothold for the army. She was doing her best to placate them and this recent victory in Vitris would be a key aspect of her argument, but she wanted the party aware nonetheless.

Unexpectedly, Yahg’s consultant was none other than Elkelin. The party was happy to work with him after his help in the battle and they set off that day for the lands of the Holte estate. Discussion among the group during the journey was primarily focused on figured out how they might convince Bertram to release the shackled star. As they neared the estate, a strange convulsion rippled through the Flesh. The spasm/earthquake did not have any obvious source and Constanze, when contacted by AIDA, refused to explain it. Unsettled but determined to finish their business with Holte, they continued until a barrier around the estate brought them up short.

A quick magical examination confirmed that it wouldn’t harm the Javelin, though presumably it would alert Holte to their arrival. Once they had passed through it AIDA received a number of messages from Anne Lupine that had clearly been sent over the course of several days. She had been attempting to recall AIDA for participation in an attack on the castle which had evidently gone poorly, forcing her to retreat to Revat. AIDA responded with an agreement to meet her there and was told not to travel via the Javelin in order to avoid detection.

Of course, it was too late for that. Not long after the party had begun to travel on foot Hale informed the party that Holte and a small force of his soldiers had come to the Javelin to seek out the party. Figuring that this was as good a time as any to speak to him, they arranged to meet in the town of Tornik.

Holte confronted the party with the information that AIDA was a known associate of Lupine and asked her for an explanation. AIDA truthfully answered that she had been deceiving Anne and had nothing to do with the attack. He asked, then, if the party would be willing to deal with her. Since her usefulness to them was minimal, they had no compunctions about eliminating her. With a more cooperative atmosphere established, Eve broached the topic of replacing the star. He flat-out refused, saying that he would not allow the progenitor of his line to die. In the days that the celestial was still an angel it was a parasite of the god it served and thus a vampire itself. Of particular note was the fact that he accidentally let slip that he needed it to continue making other vampires and, indeed, intended to do so.

He did, however, agree to allow Elkelin to assess the power needs of the estate’s towns if the party insisted on trying to alleviate the burden on the sun. With the matter of stealth no longer an issue the party flew over to Revat. On the way, AIDA asked Sepharial whether parasitic relationships of the kind Bertram had described could exist between angels and gods. She confirmed that they could and that they would be harmful to the deity in question.

Anne was still operating out of the Happy Allium and originally the party’s plan was simply to walk in and attack Anne. Mary, however, suggested that she get the rest of Anne’s resistance group to turn against her by accusing her of being a doppelganger. She managed to pull this off with a combination of sheer luck and clever use of the fact that AIDA did not actually have to obey members of the Subnetwork. The moment the group had Anne alone, AIDA simply slit her throat. She recalled herself to the airship with the body while Mary convinced the Eclipse to let the party deal with Holte.

By the time the party was done with their errand, Elkelin and the head machinist of the estate had finished their estimates. He would need to manufacture two batteries of the type used in Vitris to cover all of the estate, which was less than he had feared but would still require a number of days to make. Concluding that they could not do anything about the sun until its replacement was in place, the party sent Hale off with Elkelin to get started on the batteries.

Remembering Holte’s request from their last visit, the party offered to kill the vampires occupying his family crypt in lieu of anything else to do. Bertram was surprised by this but had no reason to object. Hundreds of vampires littered the way to the crypt, each of them essentially stuck in place absorbing blood from the Flesh to prevent from burning to death in the sunlight. AIDA was able to destroy most of them with magical sunlight since there was no way for them to fight back.

The entrance of the crypt was inscribed with a phrase in celestial that read “Pay your respects or suffer”. Scrimblo realized that this was referring to bowing, which would allow those who passed through to avoid a trap upon entry. Although the crypt itself was lit, a spell had been placed on it to prevent external light from coming in, making it somewhat disorienting on first entering. Statues and plaques on this upper level indicated that pets and servants were interred there. A floor deeper likely contained the lesser members of the line.

The party followed a trail of conspicuously clean floor to an elaborate ballroom filled with dancers - but only in the mirrors on the walls. The mirror dancers took the party roundabout to the southern exit of the room where they found the culprit to be a large gelatinous cube. It was harmless so the party let it be in favour of seeing what else might be found in the southern wing of the crypt. One of the nearby doors led into a room filled with cages that held shadows. Eve was able to free them by cutting apart the bars on the cages, allowing them to depart.

Evidently, the Holte line had been transformed into vampires prior to the building of the crypt, as the next two rooms were a wine room and a small lounge. Mary handily finished the ongoing game of pool that had been set up in the lounge, winning a magic cigar as a prize.

Another trip through the ballroom brought them back to the central chamber from which they headed to the west. The first vampires were found in the loculi and despite their numbers they were no match for the party.
