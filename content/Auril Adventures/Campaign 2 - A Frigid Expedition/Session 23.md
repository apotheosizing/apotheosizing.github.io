# Session 23

Mendelain passed Sohcahtoa's question on to Nimbus. They explained that the standing stars acted as teleportation relays, facilitating travel over the ice. As the Ice Breaker was sailing closer to Ah-vel's hub with each passing day, he asked them if they had placed any safeguards over the area. They replied in the negative, though it had been many years since they had created the hub.

All those aboard the Ice Breaker were suddenly overcome by the knowledge that a ritual was underway. The followers of Wr'umb'il'ooo were in the process of causing an eruption that would wreak havoc upon the sea. If they wanted to stop it, they had one hour until its completion. Jeremiah suggested they merely leave the effected area but the party's agreement with Gul'um'oob'pil made their decision for them.

Full speed ahead brought the party to the base of the volcano with only minutes to spare. The five adventurers came ashore near a small village built under its fiery gaze. The remnants of ritual sacrifices used to power the ritual were dotted around an altar where a black flame burned over the corpse upon it. As had been the case with other kuo-toa, their appearance had been changed by their god and each body was dried out in contrast to the usual aquatic look of the kuo-toa.

With no time to lose, the party ascended to the top of the island. By their best estimates, only seven minutes remained until the ritual would be complete. In the scorching heat at the mouth of the volcano, a group of a devout kuo-toa were casting the spell, watched over by their fellows. Knowing the parameters of the ritual, Korvias knew that if he could get close enough to cast silence - interrupting the ritual - its casters would die, ending the potential threat.

Aided by magmins summoned from the lava, the kuo-toa tried to hold off the party long enough for the spell to incinerate them. However, Korvias was able to move into position and enact his plan. Once the ritual was ended, it was simply a matter of defeating the remaining warriors.

As the party returned to the sea, they noticed that the water roiled chaotically around the now dormant Wr'umn'il'oo. They were not the only beings in the area who had become aware of the ritual being performed at the volcano. At least a dozen small gods and their followers had come to prevent the success of the spell but each faction had become embroiled in conflict with each other upon their arrival. Fortunately, they were more occupied with each other than with the small boat passing in their midst and the party was able to reach the Ice Breaker without incident.

From the safety of the ship, Eve was able to get a proper look at the battle beneath the waves. Notably, it seemed that the fragments of the statue Korvias had tossed into the water had survived, as the top half of the statue was likewise observing the battle. Eve informed Mendelain of its presence but given that it hadn't been participating in the conflict, they agreed that it would be fine to leave the statue be.

The following day, the party was informed that a member of the crew was unable to leave their quarters. As the only thing that had changed aboard the Ice Breaker was Mendelain's hallowing of it, the party quickly concluded that the crewmember in question was being affected by the strictures of the spell. Atura had no real problem with being confined to the lower deck, since they didn't have to work, but they did inform the party that they were a fiend when they expressed a willingness to lift whatever condition was keeping them trapped.

There was some debate about whether or not it was worth re-casting the spell once it was removed, since it required both costly components and meant another sleepless night for Mendelain. In the end, Eve exchanged her dagger of venom for the required materials from Acacia and the hallow was set down a second time.

By the time the hallowing was complete, the Ice Breaker was passing close to their destination. Excitement rose among the crew, though Hale reminded them that they would still be sailing for a few days yet. Before they arrived, however, the Sea of Small Gods had one final obstacle for them. 

Overhead, Narthaniel called out the sighting of a dragon as its shadow darkened the deck. The size of the shadow should have made spotting the creature a simple task but he couldn't make it out. When the party came abovedecks, they realized why. It was only a shadow, made animate by the kuo-toa. Due to the fear effect of the hallow, the kuo-toa themselves had difficulty boarding the ship, allowing the party to focus on defeating the dragon shadow.

It attempted to hide in the shadow of the few of its worshippers that managed to get aboard but the undivided attention of the entire party was a formidable force. Though one of Hale's guards was killing in the battle, the party was able to slay the dragon shadow in time to revive them without great cost.

After the fight, Hale grumbled about the likelihood of another attack just before they reached shore if this pattern of attacks held. Acacia took that opportunity to unveil the limbs she had designed with Gauss. Four legs and a tail reduced the ship's reliance on favourable winds and currents, speeding the final leg of their journey significantly.

Within two days, they arrived at the sandblasted remnants of a port town. Jeremiah, truly excited for perhaps the first time since they had set sail, immediately arranged an expedition to the ruins in the hopes that this would be the next discovery to make his name in archaeological circles. Meanwhile, the party devised their plan for reaching the teleportation hub. It would not have been feasible with the large number of crew and passengers on the Ice Breaker, but for their small party Eve would be able to facilitate their travel on the wind - transforming what would have been a weeks-long journey into a day trip. Thus, they decided that the five of them (and Yugo, who was eager to record a firsthand account of whatever they found) would set out later that day.
