# Session 21

With Mary's arrival on the scene, the party began to regain the ground they had lost. Mendelain was released from his banishment and thus, with all five of the party in the fray, the kuo-toa's god was destroyed.

Though the lighthouse was only a small god, word of the party's accomplishment spread through the ship with a sense of awe. Even the old guard among the sailors, who had been sailing with the Ice Breaker since their departure from Auril, were impressed by the magnitude of this feat. Jeremiah even descended to the lower deck to ponder the theological implications of what had transpired with the party. However, Pennett and her group remained stony-faced.

In light of this continued suspicious behaviour, Eve and Nova informed the rest of the party about their suspicions. Deciding that they would need to take proactive measures, Nova spoke to Narthaniel to ask him if he had seen Pennett and company doing anything notably odd. He mentioned that he had seen several of the crew loitering around the hold at the bow of the ship. The party enlisted Sal and Sohcahtoa's familiar to watch the hold and inform the party of any of Pennett's group's actions within it.

The party was drawn upstairs by the sound of a struggle to find that another group of kuo-toa had boarded the ship. They attempted to steal the cannon and expressed an interest in Mendelain when he transformed into his fully celestial appearance, but the party was able to fend them off before the kuo-toa could take either of them.

At the end of the battle, Nova received a message from Sohcahtoa to inform her that several of Pennett's crew were moving boxes around in the hold. When confronted, they claimed that they were attempting to organize the hold according to their higher military standard, but as they were moving oil and gunpowder barrels, the party was unconvinced.

The party returned to the main deck to inform Hale and Jeremiah of what they had seen while below, Pennett's group accelerated their plans, realizing that the jig was up. By the time the party reached the hold, all of the mutineers had gathered. During the ensuing battle, Pennett made her plans clear - she intended to kill all aboard the Ice Breaker and report their success to the Baron to reap the rewards. Informing her of the Baron's demise did not deter her so the party had few qualms about killing those of the mutineers who did not surrender.

Two days later, after Mendelain successfully petitioned Mara to remove the influence of the Flesh from Eve, Narthaniel spotted a landmass on the horizon. The party headed out toward it in a dinghy and it became clear on their approach that the island itself was moving through the water. Several paths on the island led to a small circle of dwellings.

Approaching the largest of these dwellings, Mendelain cast a spell to allow him to communicate with whoever was inside. To their knock on the door, a kuo-toa responded by inviting them in for a chat. His name was Ploob'oobl'plap'blap and he had been a resident of the island for many decades. He was happy to extend his hospitality to the party, as they received very few aside from the attacks of heretical kuo-toa groups.

As the party suspected, the island itself - Gul'um'oob'pil - was the god of the kuo-toa who lived on it. Ploob offered to facilitate a conversation between the god and the party and, after some discussion, they agreed. He led the party to a small clearing at the centre of the island and fell into a trance that summoned Gul'um'oob'pil in her former mortal form.

She explained more of the nature of the kuo-toa to the party, having come to understand it over her many years of godhood. Their obsession with creating gods reflected their unique place between being mortal and being divine, but the majority of their gods turned malevolent and led them down darker paths. Gul'um'oob'pil entreated the party to slay any more of these gods that they came across so that she might embrace them before they fell under the influence of other gods that lurked in the depths of the sea.

Though her request was clearly motivated by expanding her base of worshippers, the party agreed to assist her, as she did at least have better interests for the kuo-toa in mind. In thanks, she bestowed a boon of protection on Nova and indicated that she would follow the Ice Breaker on their journey to the central landmass.

Once their conversation was concluded, Ploob became lucid once more and extended an evening of hospitality to the party. They decided to stay overnight and enjoyed the fruits of the island before heading back to the Ice Breaker to explain the arrangement they had come to with Gul'um'oob'pil.

Back on the ship, Bjork was organizing a fishing contest. He would award the crewmember who caught the largest fish the prize of choosing the next week's worth of meals. The party decided to take part, netting themselves some surprising finds.

Mary and Nova caught a few large sharks between them and, as Nova landed two, she was declared the winner of the competition. Eve and Mendelain reeled in a pair of golden carps who bestowed on them a small wish in exchange for being returned to the sea. Mendelain received several diamonds and Eve learned of the dangers of the land to which they were travelling.

Mendelain's second cast fished up a crate containing one of the mysterious Ioun stones and Eve, catching one of the carp once again, asked it to remove the Flesh's infection from Sal. It obliged, finally ensuring that the Flesh no longer held sway over the party. As the winner of the day's activities, Nova went to show off her accomplishments to Sal, prompting some good-natured teasing from Mary.
