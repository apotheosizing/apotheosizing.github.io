# Session 22

As the Ice Breaker renewed its course, the weather turned more temperate, to the point that even Jeremiah emerged from his study to spend time on the main deck enjoying the sunshine. The party followed suit and happened to hear Hale and Acacia having a dispute about their route to the central island.

Acacia, with a tree's long view of time, didn't see the problem with taking a circuitous route to their destination, which Hale flatly objected to. Furthermore, he disliked the amount of hydrodynamic drag her modifications to the ship were adding. Together, the party did their best to convince Acacia that Hale was right, but the matter was not entirely settled.

However, by the time afternoon began to wane, Eve decided to introduce Acacia to Gauss. Since he was the original creator of the Ice Breaker, he would have both the background and the familiarity to offer consultation on her changes. The two hit it off immediately and would end up spending most of the next several days planning ambitious overhauls to the Ice Breaker's design.

The calm was interrupted by the appearance of one of the anglerfish kuo-toa on the deck. Unlike during the party's previous interaction of this sect of kuo-toa, she had no hostile intentions toward the crew. Mendelain learned that she wanted to make an offering to "the glowing one". After a moment of confusion, he realized that she was talking about him.

Feeling uncomfortable with the idea of accepting such a gift directly, Mendelain informed the kuo-toa that he would give her gift to the glowing one himself. She accepted this and swam back into the sea while Mendelain headed to one of his shrines to offer it to Mara. During his prayers, the shell was kicked off the altar, leading Mendelain to conclude that it must be evil. Though he had a moment of hesitation, he asked Dunkin to destroy it.

In the hopes that he might be able to redirect the kuo-toa's worship toward Mara, he asked Hope to fabricate some of the ship's supply of lumber into a statue of a winged figure with Mara's face. With the use of the light cantrip, he was able to keep the statue glowing so long as he was awake to cast the spell.

As soon as the next morning, the effectiveness of the statue was proven. Every so often, a kuo-toa would toss up small offerings onto the deck of the ship. Mendelain was rather pleased with this development and even offered a sermon or two on Mara's virtues, until Nimbus contacted him. They gently suggested that his innovative solution might cause more problems in the long run.

This was enough to change Mendelain's mind on the matter and, after some discussion with the rest of the party, Mary decided that it would be easiest to simply destroy the statue and let Gul'um'oob'pil gather up the worshippers. Using the cannon, she blasted the statue into pieces which seemed to end the matter, though the party was concerned by the fact that it appeared to move its head before it was blasted apart.

While Korvias began tossing the pieces off the side of the boat, Mary asked Acacia if she had any interest in incorporating the wood into her tree. She declined, saying that it felt strange, similarly to the wood at the bottom of the boat. Remembering the passage of research that Jeremiah had read to them about kuo-toa, the party realized that the ship had been infused with their magic.

To avoid the potential problem of the ship rising as a new god, Mendelain  spent a day desecrating the lower hull to undo the effect the kuo-toa had put into motion. With their free time, Dunkin and Korvias raised the crew's morale with a shockingly good choreographed tap-dancing routine and Mary recruited Acacia as the third member of a renewed coven.

Not long after Mendelain completed his spell, an eerie song rose up from the water. All of the ship's regular crew fell under its sway, falling into a magical sleep. Like the lighthouse before it, a small contingent of faithful kuo-toa boarded the ship as their god approached. These kuo-toa's forms had been likewise changed by their abilities into ones that resembled the distortions caused by thick glass.

While the party fought off the kuo-toa, both the tentacles of a squid and the mouth of a whale spilled up over the side of the ship, belonging both to the same entity - their god. Despite the party's best efforts to balance proximity with safety, all but Korvias were swallowed by the god. With Dunkin killed and Korvias himself hanging by a thread, he began to climb the ship's mast in the hopes of outrunning the creature.

Within, Mendelain took a gamble. He activated his spear inside the god, producing a blast that forced open the whale's mouth, causing both him and Mary to be ejected. They rallied against the god and slew it, allowing Eve to clamber out of its corpse.

Bjork laid claim to the body, interested in the possibilities that preparing the flesh of a god might offer, much to Mendelain's distaste. In light of the reminder of the potency of the kuo-toa's creations, Mendelain decided to once again hallow the ship in Mara's name. He conveyed unto it protections against elementals and fiends and a property that would cause fear to those enemies who stepped aboard it.

Sohcahtoa, who looked like she had finally gotten a good night's sleep for the first time since the party had met her, approached Eve with an invitation to set up the telescope she had finished building. She hoped to begin making a star chart and perhaps name a few constellations if the weather cooperated. Eve was happy to help and the two headed up to the crow's nest that night.

During their conversation, Sohcahtoa pointed out a peculiar feature of the night sky. Over the centre of the disc, a "standing star" shone down. At Auril's centre, there had been reports of a similar phenomenon - a strange star that did not move with the seasons. Knowing what she now knew, Sohcahtoa posited that these standing stars were linked to Nimbus' teleportation hubs. Since the party had a direct line to the creator of the hubs through Mendelain, Eve promised to ask them for an explanation in the morning.
