# Session 14

As Hale and his crew circled the edge of the disk, they came eventually upon a port much like the one that had been used at the beginning of the expedition. It flew the flag of that they had seen at the outpost prior, marking it as an arm of the military operations in the area. Two inspectors came out to meet the Ice Breaker, equipped with the usual questions for a returning merchant ship.

The true story of the Ice Breaker's voyage was unexpected but easily believed, as all those aboard were obvious foreigners to Ahv-el. Not having any procedure for visitors from another disk, they suggested Jeremiah speak with the baron if he wanted to be cleared to enter the Silver City.

The party accompanied Jeremiah down into the city. While they travelled down the side of the disk, Sal mentioned to Mendelain that they had been experiencing strange dreams of late. He attempted to remove any curse they might be under, in the event that they were the product of more than Sal's subconscious.

As most of the party came from a hamlet of only a hundred people and Mendelain from a secluded temple, the bustle of the city was a little overwhelming at first. They headed in through the merchant's quarter, where the party stopped in at the shops in the area. When Sal's gold was not accepted by the local jeweler, they exchanged their currency for that used in the Silver City: scales.

With the favourable rate of exchange, Korvias attempted to convince the bank that platinum was worth twenty gold apiece with little success, as they had not encountered the metal before. After some time exploring the city, the party headed to the palace. The baron, a halfling named Edwin U. Silversail, greeted them all in the throne room before breaking off to speak with Jeremiah privately.

While the two conversed, the party took some time to stock up on supplies and chat with the locals. Mary, with Sal in tow, went to the gold district to see what the outlook on the baron was among the common folk. She learned that though working conditions for those in the city's mine were rather poor, there was nothing resembling a revolutionary movement. The people were afraid to oppose the baron given that he was a powerful and ancient silver dragon.

Via sending, Jeremiah summoned the party back to the palace where the baron addressed them again. Jeremiah had spoken highly of their abilities, prompting him to request their assistance, with the implication that refusing would keep the Ice Breaker held at inspection until they helped him.

Productivity had decreased in the mines, apparently due to the workers being harried by monsters. Likewise, the main waterway, where runoff leeched in from the mines, had been blocked off. Guards had been sent into the waterway to clear whatever was causing the problem and had not returned. The party agreed to take a look at it in the morning.

After procuring a map of the sewage system beneath the city, the party headed down into the water main. With metal leeching into the water for years, it was hazardous enough to humanoids that the party had to ward themselves against the miasma in order to ensure they wouldn't become sick from contact with the toxic materials.

Thanks to the map, Mary was able to identify what should have been a fork in the tunnels. A door stood in that spot but it was revealed to be an illusion when the party attempted to interact with it. The deliberate concealment suggested that the problem lay beyond it.

Murky water in the area beyond concealed a number of traps that ensnared several of the party. To avoid using trial and error to detect the traps, Korvias cast a spell to allow them to walk on the water's surface and proceed safely.

On the other side of the room, they were attacked by a ball of skeletons that broke apart into individual skeletons after sustaining enough damage. Nearby, the party found a pile of armour that suggested the skeletons had once belonged to the force of guards who had been sent down to investigate.

Not far from the remains of the guard, the party heard the sound of voices. One insisted that changing the regime under which the city was governed was crucial while the other doubted that the revolution would manage to accomplish anything before being ousted by another group with a competing vision. When the party stepped into view, they learned that the speakers were flameskulls.

Before hostilities broke out, Mary told the flameskulls that they had no love for the baron and would be willing to assist them in bringing their plans to fruition. After establishing the truth of the party's words, the flameskulls took them to meet the leader of the operation to discuss matters further.

The fledgling revolution was headed by a triton named Bruce who had reanimated a small force of undead to disrupt both the waterway and the mines. As the only living member of the revolution, he was the defacto leader but he had no real passion for the role. Ideally, before he deposed the baron, he would find someone to properly serve as the new leader of the city.

He discussed his plans with the party, revealing that he intended to reanimate a dragon to assassinate the baron. He had many of the pieces of the skeleton that he needed but was missing a skull. Fortunately, a dragon skull could be found in the city. Unfortunately, it served as the baron's throne.

Stealing it from under his nose would be a difficult task, though one that would come later. Bruce agreed to stop obstructing the mine to allow the party to make their way into the baron's graces and, once he was sure they weren't going to turn on him, he would contact them with further plans.

With their task completed, the party returned to the baron. They claimed that an alchemist had been polluting the water with the results of his experiments. The interaction between the various mixtures had caused strange reactions and mutations that created the monsters that had been infesting the mines. With the alchemist taken care of, both issues should be resolved. Satisfied with their word, the baron allowed the Ice Breaker to be brought down to the city.

The crew took to the streets with excitement, happy to have made proper landfall after so long on the ice. However, Sal remained disillusioned with the mission that lay ahead for the Ice Breaker. Over dinner in the city with Nova, they told her that they intended to retire from active adventuring. Nova understood and told them that she would take their position in the party, so that they would not feel that they were putting their family at risk in doing so.

Back on the ship, the party was unexpectedly visiting by the Guardian. They offered to heal the party once again but before any of the party could agree, Sal begun to scream in pain. From their body, a horrible creature of flesh pulled itself forth, leaving their body as little more than a shed chrysalis on the ground. As the party looked on in horror, the Guardian expressed their disappointment that this had happened prematurely but decided the way things had progressed would be sufficient for their purposes. Horrified but with no time to grieve, the party prepared to do battle with the Guardian.
