# Session 12

With the orb that projected Marina Swan's message in their possession, the party made their way back through the empty city to the cave where the gnolls had taken up residence. They informed the Boss that they had neutralized the living spells that had been causing trouble for her scouts before heading back to toward the Ice Breaker.

Not far from the cavern, the party encountered the Guardian. They had been injured themself but offered healing to the party as a preface to a request to see the city they had just explored. The party declined out of concern for leaving the ship alone after seeing the flying ships overhead days prior but offered to tell the Guardian what they had seen. However, the Guardian did not have the time and instead headed off elsewhere.

Toward the evening, the party came across the corpse of a young remorhaz. The worm-like creatures were known for their resistance to both the heat and the cold, prompting Sal to harvest materials from it in order to make a ring. The party butchered the remains for Bjork, hoping that it would be edible. Young creatures were rarely alone, though, and its parent and another young remorhaz approached the camp in the night. Given that the party had an idea of its weakness and resistances, they were able to defeat the remorhazes and complete their rest.

After an uneventful two days of travel, the party was startled by the sound of cannonfire as they approached the slope where they had entered the canyon. At an increased pace, they reached the ship at the tail end of the battle. The bodies of frost giants and polar animals littered the area around the ship. Nova, who was manning the cannon, explained to the party that the unnatural fog that accompanied the giants they had fought in the "forest" had rolled in several days ago and they had been fending off attacks ever since. There had been a few injuries but no deaths among the crew.

With the party's arrival, the crew prepared to weigh anchor. The party informed Jeremiah about the nearby disk and showed the orb's message to Jeremiah, who was intrigued by its contents but didn't have time to examine it himself. He gathered Hope, Kijenor, and Larold together to execute a plan to lift the ship over the chasm. Jeremiah polymorphed into a dragon while the other wizards augmented his abilities to ensure he would be able to carry the ship across the gulf before the spells wore off. It was not a smooth ride by any means but it appeared that the ship would reach the other side before the end of the hour.

It wouldn't be as simple as waiting the hour, however. A familiar flying vessel came into view, crewed by a number of frost giants under the thrall of the same unknown force they had encountered before. Their sheer numbers would have made fending them off difficult were it not for Mendelain banishing the ship's navigator to a demiplane. Not only was she providing directions, she carried an enchanted item that kept the ship aloft and her absence caused it to plummet to the ground, eliminating most of the threat in one fell swoop.

Once the giants had been defeated, the party took some time for themselves. Mendelain used both the statue he had taken from the empty city and the one Gauss had made to erect two shrines to Mara on the main decks while the crew of the Ice Breaker needled Sal about their crush on Nova. With a bit of a rocky landing, the ship safely made it across the canyon and continued on under the directions of the astrolabe.

As the party waited to reach their next destination, Eve and Mendelain used their knowledge of Marina Swan's name to scry on her. Their efforts showed them an iridescent kaleidoscope of colour against a dark void. Neither of them could make heads or tails of it until Mary took a look, determining that it was a strand of the Weave of Magic. The party speculated that changing the nature of the world so drastically might have transformed her into a fundamental aspect of it but they couldn't come to anything conclusive.

After some days of travel, the ship reached a fortress that appeared to have been carved directly out of a glacier. Several ships were tied down near the fortress and visibly had crews working aboard them performing maintenance and resupplying. The Ice Breaker came to a halt a little ways off and the party was sent in to investigate.

They were met by a lizardfolk garbed in thick fabrics and fur to guard against the cold who ushered them inside. Their dialect of Common was different than the one the party was familiar with but it was not so different that they had trouble communicating. They were curious to hear that the party had travelled from another disk and explained that though the Keep-It-All was a stop for less reputable ships, it was a neutral ground and they had nothing to worry about beyond a few bar fights at worst.

The party spoke to the bartender, who after charging an arm and a leg for drinks, explained the origins of the parley. Of late, the merchant ships they had been preying on had hired private military contractors to patrol the shipping routes, making piracy much more difficult. The bartender told the party that if they wanted to garner some respect in the area, they would do well to destroy some of the military ships on their way to the disk.

As newcomers to the area, the party thought it unwise to involve themselves in armed conflicts that might complicate them setting up communication and travel back to their home. Once it was clear that the tavern did not have much else that would interest Jeremiah, the party returned to the Ice Breaker to inform him of the political situation they had gleaned.

Jeremiah, in turn, told the party that he had done some research into the Hands of Mystral. it was supposedly a title bestowed on any magi of incredible ability in the distant past and many of their recorded works seemed apocryphal but creating the prison of ice around the Flesh at the planet's centre would have indeed been within their abilities.
