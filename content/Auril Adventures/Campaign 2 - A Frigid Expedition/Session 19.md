# Session 19

By dropping several influential names at the ticket booth, Nova was able to secure a box for the party from which they could observe a majority of the audience. As patrons trickled in for the show, the party discussed their plan. Royai would certainly arrive in humanoid form, both for practical considerations and to conceal her presence. Spells like detect magic were too short-range to be effective from their place in the box but Eve was able to use a divination spell to uncover that two individuals were present in the theatre who were under magical effects.

One, in the neighbouring box, had disguised themself and the other, in the seats below, was polymorphed. With little else standing in their way, Nova let loose a volley of cannon shots on the polymorphed Royai, interrupting the performance. In the chaos, she reverted to her true form and flew up into the box to engage the party. Her body double likewise sprung into action.

The fight was brief, as on a draconic scale Royai was rather young, but she managed to do significant damage to the party before they felled her. Following the assassination, the party hurried to the nearest entrance to the sewer system to make use of Bruce's recently-vacated lair to await to Baron's move in response to their attack.

Mendelain sent a message to Bruce informing him of their success and providing advance warning that they would soon have the white dragon skull required to resurrect the skeleton he had been working on. All else was quiet that evening, in contrast to the coming morning. The party was jostled awake by the sound of cannon fire above.

The streets of the Silver City were in uproar, with the guards making use of the tactics they had used in Artisan Alley on a grander scale. On their way to the palace, the party encountered a squad of guards executing civilians in which they intervened, freeing those they could while eliminating the guard.

As they approached the Cloud District, the roar of a dragon drew their notice. The Baron had taken to the skies, flying in the direction of Fort Nest. Taking advantage of the absence of both the majority of the city guard and the Baron himself from the castle, the party retrieved the skull and delivered it to Bruce in his lair below.

Reanimating a long-dead dragon was no easy task and they had increasingly less time as the guards massacred people in the streets. Bruce set to work as soon as the skull was in place and the ritual would require the entire evening to complete. Mary and Nova returned to the city proper to defend the people as best they could in the meantime.

In transit, Mary was intercepted by a man in a trenchcoat. It was clear from his words that he was the one who had sent the letter hinting that he knew of her earlier killing. Unexpectedly, he attacked her with a silvered stake, apparently under the impression that she was some creature of the night. During the struggle, it was revealed that he was Greg, former crewmember of the Ice Breaker. Mary spared him no mercy and he became just another body left in the streets that night.

At dawn, Bruce completed his ritual. He was too exhausted to accompany the party but the skeletal dragon would more than make up for his absence. He also informed the party that Fort Nest had been retaken by the Baron. Only Inspector Wilkes and a few wraiths had managed to survive his onslaught and Bruce warned them that the Baron would likely be waiting for them at the palace.

His assumption was correct. At the top of the main staircase to the audience chamber stood the Baron in all his draconic glory. He sneered at the party's approach, telling them that they were fools to oppose him. The party had little patience for his theatrics and jumped into the fray.

Unlike his daughter, the Baron was a force to be reckoned with, but the party had been able to prepare to face him in the hours leading up to their assault on the palace. Between Eve and Mendelain, all of the party was kept in fighting shape and the dragon skeleton drew most of the Baron's ire through sheer anger at having his prize stolen from him.

When it became apparent that the Baron would not be able to kill the party before they overwhelmed him, he remained resolute that the party would be destroyed by his forces. Sure enough, the guards who had survived the uprising in the streets were flooding through the gates of the palace and approaching the battlefield.

The captain of the guard set foot in the castle at the moment the Baron was slain, blanching at the sight of the mighty dragon's death. They surrendered without any further resistance, effectively ending the rebellion. Bruce and Wilkes came to join the party at the palace not long after, summoned by Mendelain.

Bruce asked the party if they intended to remain in the city to assist in the construction of its new system of governance. As much as they wanted to lend him their support, the Ice Breaker would not wait for them forever. Eve insisted that he keep in touch, however, and they would do what they could to assist him from afar. After uncovering the Baron's hoard beneath the castle thanks to Mendelain's divination and taking any magic items that might aid them, the party called Jeremiah to inform him of their readiness to leave.

With the use of teleportation, Jeremiah brought them back to the ship, evidently not interested in waiting for them to arrive through conventional means. New faces aplenty could be seen aboard the Ice Breaker but most notable of all was the large tree that had sprouted above Jasmine's quarters and the fully-awakened dryad who inhabited it.
