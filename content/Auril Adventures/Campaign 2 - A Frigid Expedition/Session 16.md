# Session 16

Once the eyes of the guard were elsewhere, the party returned to Bruce's hideout to find that Jules had delivered on the deal she had made with Mary. Stacks of pamphlets posters sporting a design of a dragon's skull were ready for deployment across the city.

With their manifestos prepared, the next step in Bruce's plan was intercepting a caravan. As it was harvest season in Ahv-el, many farmers would be delivering produce to the Silver City from the outlying towns frequently. The farmers themselves would likely not resist an attempt to waylay the caravan given that they would have been paid for their delivery in advance. The guards, on the other hand, would not be so lenient.

Renting some horses, the party traveled to the outskirts of the Silver City and lay in wait until they heard the telltale rumbling of wagon wheels. Although the guards were trained soldiers, they could do little against the party who proceeded to make short work of them.

The party was stopped by guards at the gates to the Gold District for a routine inspection. Mary was able to charm one of the guard into waiving a majority of the requirements, allowing the party to smuggle in the corpses of the caravan guard for Bruce to make use of later.

After unloading the bodies, the party left the wagons in the Gold District for the people to help themselves to the fresh goods that they would under normal circumstances be unlikely to enjoy. Each commoner who availed themselves of the produce caught sight of the posters emblazoned with a dragon's skull as they did so.

Upon their return, Bruce laid out a number of his further plans: the first was assassinating a member of the upper echelons of society who held the loyalty of many in the city, the second involved disabling the Silver Spire to prevent the return of the arms of the military that had been sent out to protect mercantile vessels on the ice, and the last focused on disrupting the city's supply of gunpowder.

Of the three, the party settled on the gunpowder plot first. Aside from its applications in war, gunpowder was primarily used in the mines to facilitate the faster expansion of its intricate network of tunnels. When he had lived in Artisan's Alley, Bruce had seen pickups approximately every week. Being one of the more dangerous industries in the city, he suggested that the party pursue stealth unless they were willing to risk levelling a good portion of the city.

Before they could formulate a plan, Jeremiah contacted Mendelain with a message from the Baron. In recognition of their efficiency in dealing with his previous request, he sought their assistance once again and would provide further details at the palace.

Jeremiah's request that they remain on the Baron's good side spurred the party to meet with the Baron despite where their loyalties truly lay. He hoped the party could help to train members of the city guard who were lacking in certain areas. The party agreed enthusiastically with the intention to use the opportunity to undermine the rebellion's future opposition.

Using eclectic teaching methods that ranged from improper stretches to religious conversion, the party was able to not only fulfil their duties but be asked back for potential additional sessions. In the remaining hours of daylight, Korvias and Nova scoped out the perimeter of the gunpowder factory they would be targeting. Entering forcibly at night would not be an easy task due to the security measures taken during the factory's off hours but Mary had a potential in-route during the hours of operation.

Jules happened to know a former employee of the factory who was able to provide  more detailed information about its internal layout and operating procedures. Armed with this knowledge, the party went to the factory the next day to apply for vacant positions in the shipping and receiving department. Nova and Korvias were chosen from among the applicants and would begin work immediately. Korvias, who was assigned to outgoing orders, was able to look at upcoming orders and choose one for the party to attempt to intercept.

After some discussion, the party decided that the simplest means to acquire the gunpowder was to pose as the drivers picking up the powder. Unlike the factory, the mine was not hiring in any useful positions but Eve, Mary, and Mendelain were able to knock out the deliverymen and go to the factory in their place.

It seemed that the plan would go off without a hitch until they realized that they had not gotten the name of the deliveryman Eve was supposed to be. The identities of those who were picking up shipments was verified each time, meaning that their plans were about to be foiled by a lack of foresight.

However, between Korvias running interference and Eve concocting a bizarre lie that she had changed her first name due to a recent marriage, the party was able to distract the foreman long enough to find the correct name in the ledger of former deliveries. They were allowed to take the delivery with the reminder that next time name changes should be brought to the attention of the factory *before* deliveries were made.

Back in the sewers, Bruce informed the party that a public warning had gone out among the populace against associating with anyone seen operating under the symbol of the dragon's skull. Though it meant that their efforts were having a demonstrable impact, it meant that they were at risk of exposure if they pushed for another big move in the next days.

As such, the party took some time to enjoy themselves. Notably, in preparation for the assassination attempt on the veteran member of the guard Yvette Getorix to demoralize the forces, Nova insinuated herself in higher class circles. While the party traveled in the city, they noticed more and more people sporting symbols of Mara as word of Mendelain's sermons spread to all corners of the city. In recognition of his deeds, Mara granted Mendelain's request to be cleansed of the Guardian's influence. Only Eve and Sal remained infected.
