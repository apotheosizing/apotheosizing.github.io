# Session 11

Gauss' assessment revealed that while most of the hull had been damaged to some degree, the most pressing matter was repairing one of the pontoons. A hole had been blown right through the starboard pontoon, leading Gauss to conclude that full repairs to the Ice Breaker would require two weeks.

With the strength of most of the regular crew and the assistance of the party, the hull's weight was shifted such that the damaged pontoon was lifted to allow access to it for repairs. This allowed Gauss and his team to have it back in working condition after a few days of work but during that time, the crew would need to set up camp in the shadow of the ship. Though mitigated by magic, the colder conditions led to grumbling among the crew about recent events. Eve and Korvias were able to assure the crew that the adventurers aboard would be able to protect them even from the wrath of the Flesh if need be, but Greg was not convinced.

He suggested that they remove several members of the crew, such as Yugo and Cornelia, in some misguided attempt to prevent further incidents on the ship. Sal in particular did not take well to the suggestion that they leave Cornelia behind and admonished Greg accordingly, much to the amusement of the other sailors.

By the end of the week, the pontoon was fully repaired, allowing the crew to move back inside the ship. As Jasmine had predicted, the hour of her death had arrived. Eve and Mary were summoned to her quarters for one final coven meeting. Jasmine requested that her body be used to fertilize new life and, when the time came, she was buried in fresh dirt to allow the plants in her quarters to take root. That evening, in a moment of grief, Eve attempted to reincarnate her soul but the spell failed, meaning that it was unwilling or unable to return.

Over the next few days, the party continued to assist with repairs, defuse the growing tension between the crewmembers, and work on their own projects. The plant life within Jasmine's room grew overgrown at a clearly accelerated rate, prompting the party to discover a tree had grown within. It was no ordinary tree, with a dryad having taken root there, and fortunately Gauss thought its growth likely that it wouldn't interfere with the ship.

At the end of the week, the ship begun moving again but it was stopped in the late afternoon. A canyon stood in the Ice Breaker's path and though bridges of ice spanned the gap none would be sturdy enough for the ship to cross it. Simply bypassing it entire was not an option, as the astrolabe suggested something lay in its depths. After some inspection, it was revealed that a shelf of ice traced its way down into the depths of the canyon. It was possible that Hale would be able to steer the ship in if he was exceedingly careful, but the party elected to explore the canyon alone.

With supplies for several days of travel in tow and the astrolabe in hand, the party descended into the canyon. For the first time in their arctic adventures, they were exposed to the full force of the environmental conditions, wearing them down and making travel difficult. On the first night of their excursion, Sal caught sight of a shooting star with a large, canoe-like silhouette in its wake. It was reminiscent of the tales of the star-faring giants but it was impossible to be certain without encountering it directly.

Another day passed, during which the party encountered the splintered remains of ship that had plunged into the canyon. Curiously, they appeared to have sustained battle damage before their destruction. After determining that there had been no survivors, the party made camp nearby. Surprisingly, in the morning, the party was awoken by the smell of burning steak. A small hole had been carved in the ice, from which a steady stream of smoke emanated. Even more surprisingly, the astrolabe directed the party inside.

Within the cavern, the party encountered two skeletal creatures that Mendelain identified as witherlings, the undead form of gnolls. They did not appear hostile so the party followed one of them deeper into the cavern, where they encountered the gnolls' leader. She was sitting back in a rocking chair with a shoosuva curled at her feet. She introduced herself as the Boss and invited the party inside to speak.

She and the other gnolls in the cavern had been pirates trawling a well-trodden trading route around the ring that they hailed from but they had been forced into the wildness by a storm. The farther they got from the ring, the less the demon lord Yeenoghu who controlled them held sway so, despite the circumstances they were living in, the Boss had no desire to return to her home. She estimated that the Ice Breaker would be able to reach the land she had come from soon, which would allow communication and other spells to function once more.

The Boss told the party that they were free to explore the cavern but cautioned them that things deeper within had been killing the witherling scouts that had been sent to investigate. The party offered to take care of the threat to which she was amenable. Through a hole at the end of the cavern, the space opened up to reveal a frozen city. Despite the eeriness of its abandoned streets, most of its amenities continued to function; the streets were warmed and the food at the farmer's market remained preserved.

After exploring the city, the party headed to the largest building in the city. It was styled as a keep, with a high wall surrounding it, but it looked as though its initial architectural skeleton had been added to repeatedly with magic and the doors had been propped open to allow visitors inside. From the main hallway, the party entered a lecture hall. On the blackboard, the words "Emergency Evacuations" remained as a testament to the mysterious events that caused the city to be abandoned.

Yet, the building was not entirely lifeless. Sounds of popping and bashing emanated from a door to the east. The room beyond had been utterly destroyed by three floating balls of light that unleashed their fury on the party. Though they had ruined the room, they did not hold up long in a fight. Once they were inert, Mendelain and Mary voiced a theory that they were living spells that had been set loose during the event that had caused the evacuation.

Their theory was proved at least partially right by the additional spells the party encountered in their traversal of the keep but the dead gnolls in each room suggested that they had been unleashed by unsuspecting scouts from the Boss' crew. None of the living spells posed enough of an obstacle to prevent the party from clearing the keep, which hopefully would make things safer for the gnolls who lived nearby.

Through the cleric training rooms loomed a much larger threat, a death tyrant. When the party entered, the lights surrounding the skull turned to face them but rather than attacking, Sal simply gave a greeting. It quickly became clear that the skull was just a prop when the lights coalesced into a humanoid being, mimicking the dancing lights spell. It seemed amused by Sal and hung around them as they entered the final room on the floor - an office.

The nameplate outside read "Magister Kwalish" and the office itself was filled with half-finished projects and experimental magic items. Without any means to tell which were useful, the party begun to put as many as they could into the bag of holding. One of the items, a floating onyx orb, activated at the touch, projecting the image of a woman in fine robes.

The woman issued a dire warning to the magisters, saying that though she and her colleagues had constructed plans to contain the threat, there was no guarantee that the people of the city would be safe. She told the magisters to issue an evacuation order and assured him that the measures she intended to take would protect the world for many years to come. As the projection faded, she signed off with the name Marina Swan, Hand of Mystral.
