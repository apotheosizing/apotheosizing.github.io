# Session 10

A swarm of cranium rats scrambled out from Yugo's body, leaving it a lifeless husk beneath them. With the whole party surrounding the creatures, there was little chance of them surviving a battle. Recognizing this, the rats attempted to parley with the adventurers. They had slowly been hollowing out Yugo's body over the course of several years such that, at this point, his body was a mere vessel for them to control. Certain that the party wouldn't want to kill their friend, they claimed that they would return to Yugo's body and everything could go back to normal. His value to the cranium rats was as a vector for them to infest other creatures as he travelled so they had no objections to returning to the status quo.

Though it pained the party, they knew that in reality Yugo had been dead for years and the man they knew wouldn't want his body to be used to harm other people. When it became clear that the party intended to fight, the cranium rats attempted to turn their enchantment magic on the party to no avail. Once the rats had been killed, the party - and those who had been woken by the battle - went to find Jeremiah and explain the situation to him.

Like most of the crew, Jeremiah had imbibed enough at the tavern that he was difficult to rouse but Mendelain was able to set him to rights with a lesser restoration. Unexpectedly given his callousness toward most of the crew, he took the news with gravity and said that he would consult the astrolabe to find any possible means of facilitating his revival in the morning.

With no guarantee that they would find such powerful magic quickly, if at all, Mendelain performed funeral rites for Yugo and kept his body preserved against decay. Realizing that it must have been the cranium rats that bit the crewmember several weeks ago, the party took the next morning to ensure that none of them had been infected. Fortunately, none had been.

For the next two days, Mendelain spent time each dawn in prayer over Yugo's body, beseeching Mara to restore him to life. Though he had cautioned the rest of the party not to get their hopes up, as direct divine intervention was rare, Mara bestowed on Yugo a true miracle. In so doing, she made it clear to Mendelain that she would not do so for every person on the ship.

Yugo's memories of what had happened after Sal confronted him in his cabin were fuzzy, meaning that he did not remember the revelation of his true nature. Sal wanted to tell him what had happened immediately but the rest of the party wanted to give him some time to recover before hitting him with something that might be hard to take in. Sal, who didn't want Yugo to be lied to again, took exception to this and stormed away.

Korvias spoke with them later that evening, suspecting that they might sneak away to talk to Yugo alone and urged them not to, emphasizing that the party would not be keeping him in the dark forever. Sal, still frustrated, did not execute their plan though they did pour an entire box of salt into Korvias' bed that night, much to his enjoyment.

After some discussion about how to break the news to Yugo, the party went to speak with him. Given what they told him, he took the information relatively well, though he admitted that he felt that without the cranium rats he would return to being the mediocre talent he had hated being during his studies. The party assured him that they thought he was a fine musician and encouraged him to continue working on his grand epic of the expedition in spite of any doubts he felt.

Abovedeck, Jeremiah and Hale were arguing about the strange red fog in the distance. Jeremiah insisted that they head through the fog, visibility be damned, as going around it would be too much of a detour. Hale was displeased with the idea but acquiesced, continuing forward into the mist.

The first sign that something was wrong was the fact that the condensation within the mist was sticky, closer to juice than water. Not long after, it became clear that they had mist was deeply unnatural when chunks of flesh begun raining from the skies, thudding against the deck and smearing it with that same horrible liquid. It became almost impossible to navigate the Ice Breaker safely but remaining in the fog was not an option. As Hale worked on escaping, the party were on their guard for any direct threats to the ship.

The slabs of flesh that were hurled onto the deck became larger and more clearly formed, to the point that some of the mounds twisted themselves into shambling creatures that attacked the party. Horrific flying creatures swooped down from the skies to assist their brethren, unhindered by the slick layer of *something* that covered the deck.

Unlike the reanimated creatures of flesh they had encountered on the ambulatory ship months prior, these being were significantly stronger, as though more and more of the Flesh's influence had escaped its icy prison. By the time the last of the bodies hit the deck with a sickening squelch, the rain had let up, only for geysers of flesh and blood to shoot up around the ship. Hale did what he could to avoid them but one of the eruptions came up beneath the Ice Breaker itself, rocketing it into the air and causing it to come crashing back down.

Boards splintered under the force of the fall, causing unknown damage to the ship. It was still operable but there was no telling whether or not it could survive another attack. Hale redoubled his efforts to get them through the mist but it seemed unwilling to let them escape, as a death kiss and two spawn of the flesh attacked the party in an attempt to get to Hale. Their smaller number allowed the party to pick them off one by one just in time for them to see a huge tentacle burst through the hole left behind by one of the geysers.

More and more tentacles burst through the ice, reaching for the ship to stop it in place. When it became clear that they would not be able to catch it, the tentacles changed their tactics to destroying it. Korvias and Sal were able to punch a sizeable hole in the tentacles with the cannon mounted on the starboard side, allowing Mendelain's radiant guardian to evaporate it when it swung at the ship. The strategy was effective but unsustainable if the face of more onslaughts. Nonetheless, the party remained alert for the rest of the escape from the mist though no more tentacles managed to attack quickly enough.

The moment they were back in the open air, Gauss insisted that Jeremiah stop the ship so he could assess the damage and begin repairs. Jeremiah was loathe to waste time when their next destination was, according to the astrolabe, so close but the party reminded him that if the ship fell apart they might never arrive at all. There was little he could say to argue with that and he agreed with minimal grumbling to halt the Ice Breaker.

Most of the crew had sustained injuries from the battle, meaning that repairs would need to be delayed by at least a day while they recovered even with the party expending their remaining abilities to heal them. With everyone exhausted and shaken by the direct attack on the ship, Gauss begun to outline his plans for repair with the party's help.
