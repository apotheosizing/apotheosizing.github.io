# Session 15

Hoping that if they might be able to call Sal's soul back to the body of the monster the Guardian had transformed them into, the party focused their efforts on defeating the creature. With the efforts of the entire party concentrated on it, the party was able to kill the twisted mass of flesh and restore Sal to life. The Guardian was unruffled, claiming that many of the party had been infected and, eventually, they would meet the same fate.

As the party wore them down, the Guardian attempted to charm them into laying down their arms but enough of the party was able to resist the enchantment to slay them. To ensure that they would not return, Eve called upon the trees growing from Jasmine's remains to consume the Guardian's body.

Nova brought an unconscious Sal downstairs to recover while the party discussed what the Guardian had told them. Korvias deduced that they had been afflicted when the Guardian had healed them, meaning Eve, Mary, Mendelain, and Dunkin were all at risk. As Mendelain's magic had been unable to remove the influence of the Flesh from Sal, they had reason to believe that it was entwined with their bodies.

Mendelain sought help from Mara, who told him that it would eventually be within his power to heal them magically. In the meantime, however, there was nothing to be done aside from shedding their bodies.

Taking this idea to heart, Mary asked Eve to use the body she had prepared for Jasmine to reincarnate her soul into a new body. Eve was willing to do so and after an hour-long ritual, Mary found herself in a new half-elf body. Likewise, Korvias was able to form a new body for Dunkin. For Sal, Eve, and Mendelain, they had little choice but to wait until Mendelain became able to remove the infection.

In light of recent events, Sal elected to remain on the ship to take care of Cornelia until further notice, with Nova taking their position on the front line of the party. Not longer after, Mendelain received a message from Bruce. He had devised some preliminary plans to kickstart the revolution and hoped the party could look them over before they committed to any of them.

As they prepared to leave, Jeremiah intercepted them to discuss the future of the expedition. Formally, their contract with him had expired but given that both the party and the Ice Breaker were intending to head toward the centre of the disk, Jeremiah was willing to renew their previous terms. The party saw no reason to object. He reminded them that keeping the Baron on their good side would be prudent, as they would require his permission to move the Ice Breaker out to sea.

Similarly, Kijenor's agreement with Jeremiah had come to an end. Before he returned to Gehenna, he spoke with Eve about the inevitability of losing those in your life who lived short lifespans and cautioned her against refusing to let them go. Doing so had only caused him more pain, in the end. He also extended to her the hope that they might meet again some day, which Eve was happy to agree to.

Black smoke billowed over the Silver City, belching up from Artisan's Alley. Concerned that people might be in danger, the party hurried to the district. A force of town guards were burning alchemical instruments seized from those who operated in the Alley in retribution for the supposed alchemist who had been polluting the waterways. The Baron had characterized it as a preventative measure, though the party thought it was a rather transparent excuse to reinforce his authority.

After dousing some of the fires and evading the guards, the party descended into the sewer to meet with Bruce. He had been working extensively over the past few days and laid out two preliminary plans to sway public opinion in favour of the movement. The first was waylaying a supply caravan from one of the outlying cities and distributing its goods to the people of the Gold District before it could be picked over by the upper class.

The second was acquiring a printing press to allow them to distribute pamphlets and other written material to spread the sentiment of revolution. Bruce knew of one printing press in the Mage's Quarter belonging to a venue called Serendipity's Scrolls. The main obstacle to procuring it was that Serendipity and Bruce had formerly been in a relationship that had fallen apart due to differing opinions on Bruce's radical politics. If they were unable to obtain the use of the press, Nova had the technical skill to construct a one given she had access to a few key components, though it would be time-consuming.

The party decided to begin with the matter of the printing press, as it had to potential to take much longer. They opted to speak to Serendipity directly, hoping that they might be able to persuade him to assist them for Bruce's sake. This strategy backfired, as Serendipity believed that Bruce had died months ago when his shop had been destroyed and things turned hostile. Negotiations broke down further when Korvias cast silence to prevent Serendipity from casting any spells - but also prevented the party from talking him down.

In the ensuing chaos, Mary snuck down to the lower level of the shop where an assistant named Jules was working at the printing press. She was willing to print Bruce's material with compensation for the work, which Mary provided. By the time she returned to the rest of the party, the aura of silence had been dropped but both the party and Serendipity were too riled up to resolve things peacefully.

Before the guards could arrive, the party fled back to Bruce's hideout where Mary explained the deal she had struck with Jules. He would begin sending her material to print within a few days but, given that the party had become wanted on two counts of criminal activity in one afternoon, he recommended they all lay low for a week to allow the heat to die down before undertaking the caravan heist.
