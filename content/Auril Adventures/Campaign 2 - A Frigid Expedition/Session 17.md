# Session 17

Back on the Ice Breaker, a flurry of activity had overtaken the crew. In anticipation of setting sail on the seas new hands had been hired on from the city. They would require time to familiarize themselves with the ship and settle in but it would likely only be a week before the Ice Breaker would be ready to weigh anchor.

Among the party, Mary received a threatening letter only days after she had killed the guard claiming that the writer knew of her deeds. Every aspect of the letter was nondescript, meaning that discovering the writer's identity was all but impossible.

Once they had all regrouped the party turned their attention to the matter of Yvette Getorix. Nova suggested that she might be able to use one of her connections among the nobility to learn the location of her residence but the party decided to save the guaranteed method for later. Speaking with the guard under the pretense that they wanted to join the guard and needed references, one member of the guard told the party that she often travelled between guard towers across the city for surprise inspections.

Figuring that it was worth a try, the party selected a tower in the Silver District at random and, as luck would have it, Yvette was present there. Nova took the lead as the party tailed her movements through the city with the intention of discovering where she lived by simply following her to its location.

After learning that she lived in a sizeable home in the Silver District, the party returned to Bruce to discuss their plan of attack. Bruce's suggestion was that they make this a bolder move than their last two, going for something loud to send a message. Using the stolen black powder kegs they had acquired during their last mission would be quite the statement. Bruce offered to provide the party with the uniforms of the guards the party had been sent to find when they met him to allow them more leeway in how they executed the plan.

Three barrels of explosives in tow, the party went to Yvette's home the next afternoon, confident that she would be out of patrol thanks to Mendelain's divination. Rather than breaking and entering, which would leave traces that Yvette might notice, Eve teleported inside through a window and unlocked the door to allow the rest of the party inside.

The party hid the kegs under the stairs, ensuring that she wouldn't see them before the party detonated them. In order to set up a remote detonation, they would need both a fuse and something to trigger it. None of the party were trained in such work but Nova was closest.

While she worked on the detonation system, a guard knocked at the door. He had been called to investigate by members of the neighbourhood watch who had seen unusual activity around the house. Eve was able to lead him off by disappearing out the window like a thief, causing the guard to give chase. However, one of the neighbourhood watch followed up on his appearance. Mary, in full guard regalia, told her that they had the situation under control and that her interference was jeopardizing their efforts. She was disgruntled by reluctantly agreed.

By the time she had been convinced to go away, Nova had finished the detonator. All that remained was to set it off. The party was able to set up convincing patrols that ensured at least one of them was always in view of the house. When Yvette returned home for the day, Nova activated the device, causing an explosion that would've alerted the entire block were it not for Korvias silencing the area.

As they were preparing to slip away into the sewers, Yvette dragged herself out of the charred ruins of her house, gravely injured by still alive. Fortunately, the party was able to finish her off before she could call for backup. While the city began to learn of and react to what had transpired in the Silver District, the party consulted with Bruce. They concluded that they would have to escalate while the guards were still scrambling to deal with the explosion.

If the party was able to take over Fort Nest, the fortress that guarded the Silver Spire, Bruce would be able to crew it with undead and ideally be able to use the artillery they used to keep the pirates at bay to hold off the returning military.

The party was stopped on their way to the spire by a guard who informed them that the city was now in lockdown but a single guard was no match for the party. Not even the guards set at the checkpoint by the elevator up to the fort were able to pose much of an obstacle.

The fort itself, however, was crewed by fifty soldiers with access to ballistae, cannons, and mangonels. There was a central tower, which Nova had her eye on due to the cannons atop it that she could fire down onto the outer wall, three barracks, and five artillery groups on the wall. While Nova carved her way through the guards to the tower, the rest of the party split into two groups to move across the wall from opposite ends.

As soon as the party was seen on the walls, the alarm was raised and the battle began. Despite several members of the party falling under fire from the ballistae, they were able to clear the wall without any casualties. All that remained was neutralizing the tower and fending off the ground soldiers.

Nova was able to wrest control of the tower from the soldiers stationed there and use the cannons to assist the party. It took until only four soldiers and Inspector Wilkes remained for them to surrender to the party. They accepted and took the survivors prisoner to ensure that they wouldn't alert anyone in the city that they had lost Fort Nest. A quick message to Bruce gave him the signal to begin bringing his undead to the fort.

All the while, Yvette Getorix's house burned and the party knew that the Baron would soon retaliate. From this point forward, there would be no time to rest and regroup. They were now in open rebellion against the Silver City.
