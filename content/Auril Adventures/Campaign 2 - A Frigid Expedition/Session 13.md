# Session 13

A few hours out from the bar, Jeremiah informed the party that, per the astrolabe, they would be deviating from their course to the next disk. It had indicated a location mysteriously labelled as "Pensive Edgar, Wiz. App." which, unlike most of the descriptions it provided indicated a person rather than a place. The party agreed that a detour was prudent, especially since they were relatively close to their destination and it would do little harm to go see what the astrolabe was indicating.

Two days of travel were stymied by a snowstorm that picked up in the area, forcing the ship to slow to compensate for the low visibility. The astrolabe's directions took the Ice Breaker to a collection of a few small buildings. The merely serviceable construction of most of them suggested that they were temporary accommodations. A sign outside the outer guard buildings warned those who approached that trespassers would be dealt with using lethal force.

In the form of an arctic fox, Eve circled the camp. Only one building was guarded and the occupied buildings were filled with sleeping workers. Disguising herself as one of the workers, she went to a guard tower to see if she could get any information out of them. They were a little confused by the question but answered that they were working on opening a mysterious door that had not yielded even to explosives. On her way back to the Ice Breaker, she went into the captain's office, where the man was likewise asleep. He was in possession of a key, presumably to open the locked building guarded at the centre of the cluster of buildings, which Eve took with her.

Jeremiah was able to disguise the entire party as workers which, in combination with the key, should allow them to enter the middle building easily. He also handed them the astrolabe, having a hunch they might need it. They were indeed able to enter the building easily enough, descending on a magically-powered platform reminiscent of the ones at the frozen city. At the bottom sat an enormous door. A mural carved into it depicted larger than life figures standing over other individuals holding a variety of magical foci.

Though it had not reacted to any of the workers' attempts to open it, the door parted when in proximity to the astrolabe. Beyond it was a nondescript room with a gem in the wall which flared to life to deliver a warning that deadly traps lay ahead and tell the party to turn back. Paying it no heed, the party headed into the chamber to the east. Like the previous room, it appeared empty but stepping inside caused the floor to slam upward into the ceiling. Fortunately, Sal was able to react quickly enough to avoid being crushed but the problem of crossing it remained. Using teleportation and inventive use of the grappling hook, the party was able to cross the room.

Two rooms filled with identical objects were found on the other side. The party matched the layout of the furniture between the two rooms and went to open the door. It didn't budge, prompting the party to change which layout was used as the master but this did nothing to affect the mechanism. Travelling across the crushing room once again, the party picked up a key in the south room and attempted to use that to unlock the door. It exploded upon being placed in the lock.

Out of frustration, the party simply used magic to cut the door out of the wall. The gem in the next room lit up, calling the party graverobbers and challenging them to a quiz. Despite a few missteps, the party was able to answer all the questions without sustaining too much damage. Once the quiz was concluded, the gem lit up with a blue eye and spoke without the tone of something pre-recorded like all the others. They again asked the party to leave, saying that there was no treasure to be found. Over the course of the conversation, the party learned that the person on the other end was Pensive Edgar but could not get him to answer much else.

The next room brought the party into contact with a poisonous substance and challenged them to find the antidote. Examining all the bottles revealed that none of them contained an antidote but the party's concerns were put to rest by the gem smugly revealing that they had never been poisoned to begin with.

Increasingly frustrated, the party continued through a room filled with implements of torture to a series of doors. Each was able to be moved with enough force until one closed behind Sal, trapping them inside and then deluging the space with water. Luckily, the impact did not render them unconscious and Korvias and Dunkin were able to smash the stone door enough to create an exit for the water before Sal drowned.

Another room without any gem installed in it had only a bear trap without any springs and a timer. There seemed to be no way to interact with it so the party simply waited until the timer run to zero. When it did, the floor of the room snapped up like a trap, catching Mary but otherwise not doing too much harm that the party could not reverse. One final room was filled with numerous constructs that guarded the end of the gauntlet of traps. As the party prepared to battle the machines, they collapsed, clearing not having undergone maintenance for hundreds of years.

Edgar's voice returned, pleading with the party not to open the final door. The party paid him no heed and entered the room. It was filled with crystalline pillars with blue eyes peering out from each facet of the crystal. Resigned, Edgar told the party that opening the door had changed the carefully controlled environment of the crystals and that they would quickly deteriorate, killing him.

Despite the party's best ideas, it became clear that there was nothing they could do to mitigate the damage they had done. Instead, they asked him what he knew about Marina Swan. She had been his teacher until she had gone through with her plan to seal the Flesh in its icy prison. Edgar considered her actions ultimately more destructive than the being she opposed, as it had only been with the efforts of other members of the final Hand of Mystral that all life on the planet had not been wiped out.

The astrolabe, which he recognized, had been created by a cleric named Nimbus who he had admired greatly. They had left long ago to create teleportation hubs between the projected locations of the disks that would allow communication and transportation between them. The party had never heard of such monuments but figured Jeremiah might, given his long history of exploring their home disk.

In his final moments, Edgar asked the party to reconnect the disks if they could, to finish the task that Nimbus had attempted and bring a new golden age to Auril. By communing with Mara, Mendelain learned that most of the final Hand of Mystral had died, with the exception of the warlock who was unambiguously alive and Nimbus, who existed now in their god's domain.

The party returned to Jeremiah to inform him of what had transpired. He was very interested in restoring the teleportation hubs, if any had been built, as they would benefit not only his future expeditions, but would certainly make him the most revered archmage in history. With the astrolabe in his possession once again, he announced that the Ice Breaker would arrive at the next disk within two to three days and told the party to make their preparations.

Eve and Sal took what had transpired with Pensive Edgar poorly. The longer they spent on this journey, the more disillusioned Sal became with the idea of adventuring. The harsh reality of it clashed heavily with the idea of it that they had spent so long idolizing. They confided their doubts in Nova, who did her best to comfort them.

Eve, meanwhile, saw far too much of her worst fears in what had happened to Edgar and hated that he had died alone more than the fact that they could not save him. Mary, in her way, tried to assuage Eve's concerns on the matter and convince her to join everyone in getting ready to make landfall. Mendelain and Korvias, on the other hand, understandably had little sympathy for Edgar, give his vitriol toward them.

Though the entire crew had known it was coming, hearing Narthaniel announce their approach to the edge of the interminable ice two and a half days later was surreal for all those aboard the Ice Breaker. Unlike their own disk, this new land was clustered primarily along the edge of the disk with a wide ocean stretching out beyond the edge of what they could see. With their contract for the expedition complete, an entire new world now awaited the party in the land below.
