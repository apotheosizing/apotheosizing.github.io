# Session 18

Mere minutes after Bruce had finished reanimating the dead soldiers, Mendelain received a message from Jeremiah. He requested that the party meet him at his cabin as soon as possible. Leaving Mary to keep an eye on the horizon and alert the rest of the four adventurers to the return of any military vessels.

In Jeremiah's quarters, the archmage informed the party that he intended to take advantage of the current confusion to leave the city before the Baron instituted stricter controls over movement in and out of the drydock. Though he didn't have permission to leave, he did have the ability to become a dragon and move the ship to a nearby bay, where he would wait for the party.

Before he left, he informed Nova that he and Gauss had finished an experimental prototype for a portable cannon. Given her familiarity with the full-sized versions, he bestowed it on Nova to use in combat. As the party returned to the Silver Spire, one of the flameskulls Bruce was familiar with intercepted the party to inform them that a pair of incoming coursers had been spotted.

On the ramparts of Fort Nest, Bruce, a begrudging Wilkes, and the party observed the approaching ships. Wilkes knew the specifications of the ships, which were built primarily for speed with relatively few offensive options and crewed by twenty or so soldiers.

Nova and Korvias ascended to the main tower of the fort to man the cannons - the longest range weapons the fort was equipped with. Dunkin, Mary, and Mendelain acted as their firing crew, allowing them to make use of their weapons as often as possible. Eve, meanwhile, flew out in giant eagle form with the intention of slowing down one of the ships to prevent the party from being overwhelmed when both ships made landfall.

The battle was a prolonged affair, even with the exchange of cannonfire during the ships' approach. Eve was able to hold up one of the ships by slashing the sails, though she was greatly outnumbered when she landed after doing so and managed to survive only by taking shelter in the crow's nest. The other ship reached the fort but went no further, as the party was able to kill the crewmembers who had not been picked off by the artillery. Once it became clear that the battle was lost, soldiers on both vessels surrendered.

Back in the main building of the fort, Wilkes received a report that informed her of the immanent return of the Baron's daughter, Royai, from her diplomatic mission abroad. This sparked an idea from Bruce, suggesting that taking her out might be sufficient to draw out the Baron to attack the fort directly, allowing the party to steal the throne in his absence.

If that did not spur the Baron to action, they could target the stamping press at the Mint. It had been constructed at the founding of the city using techniques that had been lost in the interim, meaning replacing it would be near impossible. Through either method, things would soon come to a head.

Using divination, Mendelain determined that Royai would be at the theatre in the Cloud District the following day. While he had the incense burning, he made contact with Nimbus to inform them of Pensive Edgar's death. They were both saddened and surprised to hear of his passing, as they had not seen him in their travels of Gond's realm. There was little else to ask them but having a direct line of communication with the one who made the teleportation gates between the discs had the potential prove useful.

Korvias, Mendelain, and Nova headed into the Silver City to make some purchases and scout the premises of the theatre. The atmosphere in the city had changed dramatically, with few residents on the streets aside from guards, making it evident that they had little time to lose.
