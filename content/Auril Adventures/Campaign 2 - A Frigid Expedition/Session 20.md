# Session 20

Eve and Mary went belowdeck to visit the dryad of the tree in Jasmine's former quarters. In the weeks of their absence, the space had undergone a transformation. The overgrowth of branches had been trimmed back and a small ecosystem had been cultivated at the base of the tree. Most notable was the fact that the tree had begun incorporating the ship into itself, sealing the planks into one body.

At some point, the dryad had awoken and she seemed excited to see Eve and Mary. She explained to the pair that she had retained Jasmine's memories due to her body being the catalyst for her creation but she was, essentially, a new person. For the time being, Mary suggested the name Grimwood to her which the dryad agreed would suffice. She offered them both fruit from her tree before accompanying them to the upper deck to enjoy the sunlight.

Mendelain sought out Bjork to help him prepare the next meal. During their conversation, he informed Mendelain that he had planted the seeds he had procured from Artisan's Alley and the plants had grown rapidly. At their current rate, they produced a fruit every twenty minutes, each of which was shaped like Mara's face. Mendelain was surprised but decided that it was clearly a miraculous sign from his god herself.

Nova talked shop with Gauss about the instant fortress they'd acquired from the Baron's hoard, wondering if he had any ideas about how to repair it without the use of the wish spell. It would be exceedingly difficult but with Jeremiah's assistance, something might be done about it.

Sohcahtoa emerged from her study briefly to show Eve a map she'd purchased in the Silver City. Chimeric monsters littered the sea outside the barony and the central landmass they were journeying toward had been covered with a map patch. Still, its geographic information seemed roughly correct and would be a sufficient starting point for Sohcahtoa's own maps.

Dunkin and Sherlock had a playdate, during which Theodora filled Korvias in on Mysterium Incorporeal's adventures. Jeremiah had sent them out to scout the area, eventually leading to the discover of the bay in which the Ice Breaker now sat. During their excursion, they came across a little town called Innsport. Like any small community, it had rumours of strange happening. There was a lighthouse at the town's cape that had been built hundreds of years ago by sailors who had died in their maiden voyage after its construction. However, it remained lit despite having no keeper and those who wandered too close to it never returned.

Mysterium Incorporeal concluded that it was likely a routine ghostly haunting but when they investigated the lighthouse, they encountered a group of kuo-toa inhabiting a network of caves below the lighthouse. The four only managed to catch a glimpse of the idol they worshipped - one resembling the lighthouse - before being chased out of the tunnels. They had left the town not long after. Theodora said that they would be able to see the lighthouse on the horizon when the ship weighed anchor.

After touching base with the Crimson Streak, who had taken to teaching Cornelia with Sal, and Yugo, who was eager to hear of their adventures, the party retired for the night. In the morning, Mendelain asked Eve to speak with the Mara plants to ensure they were not malevolent. She did so and the plants informed them that they had been alchemically enhanced to grow quickly but the alterations had been imperfect until Mara had cleansed them. This was sufficient reassurance for Mendelain on their safety for consumption.

As the Ice Breaker sailed through the bay, Korvias noted that he couldn't see the lighthouse despite passing by the area of Innsport. Troubled by this, Korvias called the party to the deck. Eventually, the party caught sight of it in the bay itself, though only for a moment before it sunk beneath the waves. The party wondered if it was a mimic or under the effects of an animating spell. After some discussion, they concluded that worship from the kuo-toa may have turned it into a god and that the strange creatures on Sohcahtoa's map were previous such gods.

Mendelain was able to commune with it, confirming the party's theory. It revealed to him that it considered Mysterium Incorporeal to be its enemies, a fact which worried the party but presented them with no easy means of addressing it.

Some hours into the day, Hale drew the party's attention to the wreck of a ship against the northern sandbar. Given the decay of the wood, the ship had run aground hundreds of years ago, but all sunken vessels held the possibility of treasure. Eve and Nova went to investigate it for any useful cargo, finding a magical collar that they gave to Dunkin upon their return.

That evening, the crew gathered for drinks and arm-wrestling. Each member of the party, including Dunkin, joined in the festivities and managed to win a majority of their matches. Not all of the crew were participating in the fun, however. A small group of new crewmember were gathered near the corner of the common deck and speaking amongst themselves, with a somber tone to their words. 

Nova attempted to engage them with a game of blackjack, which they agreed to none too happily. The leader of the group, a woman named Pennett, revealed that they were formerly members of the Silver City's navy who had been discharged but otherwise remained reserved over the course of the game. Nova resolved to keep an eye on them going forward.

On the second day of their voyage, Sohcahtoa approached the party to ask them about their course to the centre of the disk. They could either travel directly to the land and make the rest of their journey on foot or attempt to make landfall in one of the areas of the landmass that were closer to their destination and reduce their overland travel. Given the greater speed of sea travel, the party agreed that doing the majority of their travel on the water was prudent.

As the sun began to set, a storm rolled in and with it, the kuo-toa and their god. The lighthouse sought to avenge itself on those who had disturbed it and attacked the ship directly, putting the party into combat with not only its followers but the god as well. Its radiance burned through the storm, shining down on the party with divine wrath. Not even Nova's cannonfire could do much more than injure it. With heavy injuries sustained by Eve and Mendelain banished to a watery abyss, the outcome of the battle was looking increasingly dire...
