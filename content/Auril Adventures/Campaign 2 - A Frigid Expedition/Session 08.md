# Session 8

Unexpectedly, Sir Grey approached Sal the very next morning. He admitted that the two had gotten off on the wrong foot and offered to teach them how to be a proper member of the nobility. Sal was willing to accept his tutelage, explaining the peculiar circumstances under which the party had inherited the manor from Jebediah Mann. Setting aside how odd the story itself was, Sir Grey confided in them that he could relate to their position, as he had inherited his title much like Sal and had yet to prove his worth. He also removed his helmet, revealing that he was a mere boy of sixteen.

In repayment for the favour, Sal decided to became his teacher in the arts of acting like a normal person. Sir Grey did not seem particularly convinced of how useful such skills would be but agreed all the same. Meanwhile, Mendelain received a request from Bjork while they were working in the galley. If his math held, he would be a grandfather now and he hoped that Mendelain might create a shrine to Mara for the use of any religious crewmembers. Given that it would be a significant morale booster after the disaster a few weeks prior, Mendelain was happy to set one up.

Later that day, Eve and Mendelain attempted to extract information from the skulls of the giants they had encountered near Mynnyr’s lair. The spirits of the giants were not forthcoming but the two learned that they were protecting the seal. The shadow creature in the obelisk had described their task similarly, implying that many of the inhabitants of the expanse were compelled to prevent the fleshy force it trapped from breaking free. Before they could bring this to the attention of the rest of the party, Jeremiah called upon the five adventurers.

After reminding the party to stop bringing every sentient person they met aboard the ship, he told them of the next destination shown on the astrolabe. The ship would be approaching a populated town soon, though he knew not who might live there. The party’s discussion of the various components and provisions they should try to purchase when they arrived was interrupted by a summons from Hale. An unidentifiable creature had flown onto the crow’s nest and it was possible that they would pose a danger to the crew.

The creature was huge but had a humanoid shape, aside from the large wings that sprouted from their back. They were encased in a sheet of ice that took the form of a set of full plate armour. Fortunately, they were willing to speak with the party and called themself a guardian.

The Guardian had approached them in the hopes that a group capable of surviving on the expanse for so long might be able to assist them. They had sustained an injury that prevented them from dealing with an incursion of the Flesh through the ice. A manor had formed nearby and they beseeched the party to eliminate the threat it posed. Despite Jeremiah’s protests, the party agreed to detour their current path to follow their directions to the manor.

The bizarre construction of the structure in the distance made it clear that the manor had not been built, as the lack of symmetry and apparently random protrusions of rooms and towers would be impossible to construct. Its rooms were sparsely furnished yet clearly in a state of disarray, adding to its odd appearance. It was only when the party stepped inside its interior that the purpose of the chaos became clear. The room was filled with mimics, who were able to blend into the environment all the easier with its haphazard layout.

Each successive room of the manor became a hunt to discover the mimics before they could ambush the party. The task was made easier by the foreknowledge that such creatures lurked inside. Korvias and Sal were able to attack with arrows at long-range while Mendelain’s radiant guardians forced mimics lying in wait nearby to reveal themselves. Doppelgangers populated the rooms in a parody of normalcy, accompanied by an oblex that led them on a chase to the second floor of the manor. Although Sal was subject to its memory drain in the struggle to kill it, the oblex had been weakened enough by the party attacking its manifestations that it was defeated in one hit from Mary when they reached it.

In the attic, a disturbingly familiar sight awaited them. An odd organ, not unlike a heart, hung from the center of the roof. Having evaded the house’s attempts to dissuade the party, the building itself came to life to make a direct attempt on their lives. With the assistance of the hands on the deck of the Ice Breaker, the party was able to destroy the house, impressing the Guardian with the group’s swift completion of their request. As thanks, they restored Sal’s lost memories and provided several diamonds to the party before departing.

Helpful as their gift appeared, a strange bead sat at the middle of the diamonds, prompting curiosity from the party. Sal handed them over the Larold for identification and the wizard determined that they were a source of transmutation magic that would cause changes in the person the diamond resurrected. However, they were uncertain what form those changes would take. They also told Sal that Kijenor had been behaving oddly toward them for some time and asked them to tell him to stop.

While Sal removed the beads from the diamonds and ground them into dust for use in restoration spells, Eve spoke to Kijenor. He explained that he had been amused by Larold, as they were not truly who they appeared to be. As an arcanaloth, he was able to naturally see through magical glamours and had found to his surprise that several people were under such effects. Not only Larold but Gauss and Yugo had altered their appearances, as well as a fiend whom Kijenor claimed had benign intentions. Eve shared his words with Sal who decided that they would get to the bottom of things once Mendelain could grant them truesight for a limited time. It would take some practice for him to learn the spell, however, meaning that they would have to remain in the dark a while longer.
