# Session 6

Kiel took a few moments to examine the body and ensure Charybdis was indeed dead. Concurrently Angel cut into the black sponge. It was not a perfect match for what she had seen with the lich's infection but she suspected that they were the same base organism specialized for different environments. She would have to wait on the dissection of the material she had given to the First Druid for confirmation on that theory.

Having time to think, Kiel questioned the rest of the party about what had spurred this attack. Angel and Pierre shared what they knew about the immediate lead-up and attention fell consequently on Temperance. They reminded their companions of the strange vision they'd had back in Hedgesfoot and indicated that they had reason to believe Charybdis was interested in them specifically.

This precipitated an argument wherein the rest of the group took the position that Temperance should have made her concerns more clear while Temperance defended herself with the fact that they didn't take what she'd told them about the vision seriously. Both arguments were muddled by the residual fear of what had just transpired and neither side was being very charitable to the other. Temperance effectively ended the discussion by walking away, returning belowdeck to be alone.

Before anyone could consider going after them, a small commotion caught the party's attention at the aftcastle. The cabin boys Jim and Toe were speaking to the captain with some urgency. Kiel, who had gotten to know the boys over the past several days, went to see what was wrong.

They explained to her that their friend Vahn was missing and, with the night's events, they were worried that something had happened to him. Ophelia, believing that it would be crueler to give them false hope, told them that there had been casualties and it was possible Vahn was among them, though she had yet to do a headcount to confirm it. The boys slumped down on the stairs to try to take some comfort in each other's company while they waited to hear more. Kiel did her best to offer them a shoulder to cry on, which they took to immediately.

Meanwhile, Pierre took Vekhmed - who had been drawn to the deck by the lingering pain of the crew - aside. He wanted to come to an arrangement with her that would keep her away from his companions: an exclusivity deal of sorts where Pierre would provide all the pain she might require. Vekhmed was willing to accept, with the full intention of holding him to his word, and even sweetened the terms by offering Pierre a minor pool of magic to use.

As the hour was late and they had exhausted themselves in the fight with Charybdis, the party (excepting Angel who only required a short trance each night) went to sleep. Ophelia ordered her people to do the same, though she remained awake to attempt triage on the damage to the ship and finalizing the count of losses. Guinevere was able to convince her to sleep in alternating shifts with her and Angel even offered to let them both get proper rest while she took care of these menial tasks, but Ophelia refused to go any further than her compromise with her wife.

That night, Temperance dreamt of lying on the shoreline in the lap of a stranger. She could not see their face or features but blue-black veils were sometimes blown into view by a soft wind. They offered her their sympathy but said nothing more.

Once all the crew and passengers were awake, Ophelia delivered the news that there had been six men killed in the attack and substantial damage to the port hull. This eliminated the crew's redundancy but would not force them to turn back on their voyage and repairs could be done over the next several days. The party did what they could to help, either by covering crew positions or directly working on the repairs themselves.

As the crew settled back into their duties, Angel tracked down Temperance to offer her apologies. Although she stood by the statement that they should tell the party about the things that troubled them, she was tired and stressed last night and didn't express herself well. Temperance, who had likewise had time to think, accepted the apology and promised that they would try to be more open with the party. As a show of good faith, they healed Angel's injuries from the battle and the two parted on better terms.

Four days passed until the atmosphere aboard the *Muros* was truly back to normal. By then, the ship had reached the mouth of the tributary they had been sailing out to the Mare Crisium and could safely increase their speed out on open water. Though they had miles yet to go, it would be measured in days rather than weeks.

About this time, Frelia reached out to Temperance, having noticed that she had been withdrawn for the past few days. Temperance, trying to take Angel's words to heart, told Frelia about Charybdis' disguise and explained some of her complicated relationship with her sister. When they were young, Temperance was the favourite child, doted on and prioritized by her parents. Her sister Silas grew resentful but Temperance was oblivious until it was too late. The two fought and Temperance had to kill Silas to preserve her own life.

Frelia was horrified by this but not because she blamed Temperance for their actions. Rather she expressed her sympathy for what had happened to Temperance and assured them that no reasonable person would demonize them for what had happened. Temperance had some trouble fully believing this, having spent so long keeping it secret, but she appreciated Frelia's kind words regardless.

Another three days went by before anything of note occurred but when it did, it was a peculiar event indeed. Jim came to collect the party on Guinevere's orders. The crew had dredged up something from the depths, which in itself was odd considering how deep the waters were, but the thing they'd pulled aboard was of unusual make. It was a statue depicting a robed humanoid figure with a functioning clock in place of its head. However, this was no *objet d'art*: the statue spoke, greeting the party in perfect Common upon their approach...
