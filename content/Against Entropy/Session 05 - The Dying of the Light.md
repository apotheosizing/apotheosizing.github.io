# Session 5

Those who took their breakfast in the galley were questioned about the *Muros*' extraplanar passenger but the lay-crew knew little more than Pierre had been told when he'd come aboard. Many of the crew were content to keep their heads down, collect their salary, and ask no questions about the daemogoth. It went without saying that none of them were foolish enough to strike a deal with a fiend. A few of the more experienced hands said that Vekhmed in particular had been with the *Muros* for a fortnight or so. They were the most recent in a string of similar passengers who all either left when their obscure purpose was fulfilled or stepped off at a port, like any other passenger might.

Pierre then questioned Frelia about Vekhmed. She told him that the origins of daemogoths were unknown to planar scholars and their classification as fiends was primarily a function of the nature of their interactions with mortals (making exchanges of power or knowledge in exchange for something only a mortal being could provide them). However, as far as she knew, the soul was never in jeopardy in these arrangements. Daemogoths fed solely on the vicarious experience of pain and had no interest whatsoever in any non-tangible goods like souls.

While the information Vekhmed had provided to Temperance seemed factual, Pierre remained concerned about the matter. He concluded that if anyone would know about it, it would be Ophelia, as it was presumably by her consent that Vekhmed was on board. The captain did not disclose the particularities of their agreement but she indicated that only coercing a crewmate or one of the party into a bargain would constitute breaking the terms on Vekhmed's side. However, while she could not command Vekhmed to do anything, she would ask it to leave the party be. Pierre thanked her and let the matter lie for the time being.

That night, Temperance was awoken, not by the creaking of the ship or the movements of the skeleton crew who were still manning it, but by an unshakeable feeling that something was wrong. They went out to the main deck to get some air, waking Angel and Pierre in the process, both of whom followed them to ensure they were alright.

At first, nothing seemed to be amiss. The sea was relatively calm and the moons overhead shone down as they always did. If Temperance saw a figure standing by the figurehead that looked like her, it was certainly just a trick of her tired mind. Then, as Angel and Pierre asked after her, she heard the sound of someone calling her name.

The wind lifted the mainmast, offering a better view of the person at the prow. It was not Temperance at all, or even someone bearing a strange resemblance to them, but their sister Silas. Without heeding their companions' words - for they couldn't see anything out of the ordinary at all - they ran to their sister's side. They half-expected to grasp thin air when they reached out their hand to her but to their surprise Silas took their hand and told them to come with her.

Still alarmed and unable to trust her senses, Temperance asked how it was possible that Silas was here. Silas did not answer at first, only insisting that Temperance go with her, but when Temperance tried to pull away she gouged deep claw marks into Temperance's arm and said only that she would tell her everything when they were gone from this place.

At this point, it was obvious to Pierre and Angel that something was wrong. They rushed to help Temperance only to be nearly swept away by a massive wave cresting over the ship and crashing onto the deck. To make matters worse, they quickly learned that a vengeful apparition was the least of their problems. On the starboard side of the *Muros*, a sea serpent flanked by a small contingent of conjured elementals had breached the water and fixed its eye on them. The boat pitching violently and the roar of the serpent saved Angel and Pierre the trouble of rousing their remaining companions. Kiel, Cosme, Frelia, Ophelia, and Guinevere all came as quickly as they could to help.

Though they were worried about Temperance, the existential threat to the ship took precedence. Pierre nearly dispatched the sea serpent by firing one of the ship's cannons point-blank into it, tearing its jaw from its face and allowing the spellcasters to finish it off.

Meanwhile, Temperance was occupied wholly with their sister. Though Silas made reference to things only Temperance themself or Silas could know, they did not allow sentiment to sway them. Fortunately, the lingering light of a well-aimed bolt of divine light not only made Charybdis - for it was she who had taken on the guise of Silas - visible to their allies, it dispelled the illusion Temperance saw, lifting the last of the guilt of attacking their sister's ghost from them.

Peculiarly, though they were far from the Septaspire, Charybdis too seemed to be inhabited by the strange material that had infected the lich they'd crossed swords with in the library. Rather than the appearance of vines, Charybdis' inhabitation seemed to have the superficial look of coral or sponge. The party did not have much time to contemplate this however as their best chance of banishing the elementals still attacking the ship was by killing her.

Angel struck the killing blow with an arrow between the eyes but it was Temperance to whom Charybdis directed her dying pleas that she join her, and that neither of them needed to be alone any longer.
