# Session 4

En route to the docks, Frelia asked the party to stop in at a shop selling spell components. They had about an hour before their agreed-upon meeting time with the *Muros* so they detoured into the commercial district. As Temperance was heading into the store, they caught sight of a strange person with sharp teeth and hair like seaweed. They turned to find that their surroundings had changed - the bustling streets were silent, empty, and lit not by the midday sun but by a low-hanging moon. This was the Horned Moon, associated with those who drew power from the primal forces of the world.

The unknown individual lamented that they had been alone for ages. A confused Temperance asked who they were and what they wanted from her and they answered that she would soon understand. They were siblings, of a sort, after all.

Once the strange vision vanished, she returned to the shop to speak with her fellow adventurers, who hadn't noticed anything strange. Although Temperance was rattled by the experience, the party didn't have any means to help them at present so they continued on to the *Muros* in order to keep their appointment.

Ophelia brought the party aboard her ship personally with a stern reminder that they would be expected to pull their weight at sea. The crew of the *Muros* was an eclectic group of people from all backgrounds but even among them one person in particular stuck out. A tall grey creature with insectoid eyes and multiple arms watched the proceedings without so much as a comment from the crew.

The party, being unfamiliar with this being, asked one of the cabin boys about them - however, Vekhmed was happy to introduce themself and offer their expertise to the adventurers. Temperance, who was still shaken by her vision, asked if they could assist in interpret the omens. They agreed in exchange for Temperance tearing out one of her nails. Broadly the adventurers were put off by this but any actual response was interrupted by Ophelia summoning them to finalize their sailing route.

The most direct route to the ruins of Annar Vult would take them on the main arterial river to the Mare Crisium where they would circumnavigate the continent and follow the Black River toward the city until it was too shallow to admit them further. Even assuming fair weather and currents, the journey would require two weeks of sailing.

Over the next several days, the party settled into a routine. Angel worked closely with the captain on navigation, Pierre first clashed with and then gained the respect of the cook by showcasing his culinary skills, Kiel attracted the admiration of the young trio of swabbies through her physical prowess, and Temperance took on a number of odd jobs in addition to their work as a healer.

Their companions were not idle either. Cosme took up a perch in the crow's nest and provided some much needed entertainment in the form of songs and stories to engage the mind through the monotonous work. Frelia, on the other hand, was rarely seen abovedecks aside from Pierre spotting her taking apples from the kitchen for use in some experiment. It seemed she was working on shifting it between planes and calling it back, though the attrition rate of the fruit suggested she had not perfected it yet.

Late one evening Temperance tiptoed out of bed to seek out Vekhmed. Her offer had weighed on her mind for days now until it had become inescapable. Vekhmed saved her the trouble of trackingher down by appearing before her, eager to accept her offering. Despite a moment of hesitation, Temperance quickly wrenched her nail from the bed. The vicarious experience of pain made the daemogoth ecstatic and she immediately shared what she knew.

The figure in Temperance's vision was none other than the sea hag Charybdis, the last survival of a coven of witches whom the Septaspire had wiped out centuries ago for posing a threat not only to travelers on their primary trade river but their own authority on the Dead Continent. The loss of the two people she loved most had driven her into a derangement of grief that transformed not only her thoughts but her relationship with magic itself. Rumour held that she was now more powerful than any lowly witch could ever aspire to be.

Vekhmed made a standing offer to aid Temperance in thwarting Charybdis' plans for them, claiming that her suffering at being denied Temperance would be payment enough. Temperance was hesitant to accept and requested some time to consider the offer. Vekhmed encouraged them to take whatever time they needed before he, simply as he'd come, disappeared.

Observant Pierre noticed the following morning that Temperance was behaving strangely so he drew her aside to speak with her. At first Temperance denied anything was wrong but it quickly became clear that Pierre would not be convinced. Thus, she shared what Vekhmed had told her, including her own theory about why Charybdis was interested in her specifically: she was a worshipper of the Weeping Moon, one of the four moons that watched over the plane. If the other members of her coven had been associated with the Horned Moon as she was, Temperance likely represented an acceptable replacement for one of them.

Pierre considered this information. Being that curiosity was a hazard of his profession, he was intrigued by both the mystery of Charybdis and the fact that Vekhmed had so much knowledge about her in the first place. He was willing to keep their interaction with the daemogoth secret from the other members of the party so long as they agreed to accept his help in discovering more. Temperance agreed and the two parted ways with much still on both their minds.
