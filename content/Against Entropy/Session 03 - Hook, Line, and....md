# Session 3

Out on the balcony, Cosme somewhat awkwardly checked in with Pierre. He admitted to being shaken by what he had seen but all the same intrigued. He doubted that the appearance of the lich was unrelated to their purpose - it wasn't the party's fault but it was their problem. Cosme, reluctantly, said that she was capable of returning Pierre to his home if he truly wished to leave. Though he gave it genuine consideration, Pierre found he was compelled by both curiosity and his own sense of justice to continue working with the party for the time being.

Meanwhile, Temperance had gone to raise the alarm. All alone in one of the library's halls, she was detained by a woman in strange attire: a mourning veil and a dress. She seemed to know both Temperance - whom she had measured and found wanting - and the lich they were seeking to inform people about. Unfortunately Temperance was too panicked to extract any information about her motives and she summarily disappeared. Not long after she bumped into another apprentice who told her that he had asked the First Druid to come help and decided to accompany him back to the damaged wing.

The remainder of the group - Kiel and Angel - were occupied by attempting to calm Frelia. Kiel was able to help her perform some breathing exercises that had some effect and took her outside while Angel examined the body of the lich. As had been noted during the fight, a strange living mass was attached to its skeletal structure. Angel knew better than to touch it directly but was able to gather a sample for potential study. A strange sheen of moisture covered the tendril and it reacted on an autonomic level to being stabbed, both details that made it clear the mass had some separate existence from the lich. 

Other members of the party wondered if the mass was a parasite of some type which had taken over the lich, or at least gained from influence over it. It resembled a vine as much as a tentacle so perhaps the lich's interest in seeds had a more worrying source. Whatever its nature, the party agreed that it would be prudent to assume it was contagious and treat it as such.

Cleric Minnema paused in her work to revive the slain students to examine the body of the lich for herself. In observing her, Pierre realized that she did not look surprised by what she saw and questioned her on the matter. Though initially resistant, she admitted that she had seen other creatures affected by the parasite over the past several months. All of the infected were simple creatures without sentience in the humanoid sense and the ones she found had been in the vicinity of the Septaspire, with the latest being a robin that attempted to enter through the window.

The party was troubled by this, wondering if this pattern represented a desire to get inside the building for some purpose. If it was smart enough to ensnare a lich, why did it bother with these weaker creatures? Was it even able to make complex decisions or was it spreading indiscriminately?

About this time, First Druid Lingenhall arrived. He set to work both personally and by directing the volunteers Minnema had gathered to ensure each of the dead was being looked after by one or two spellcasters, though he didn't seem particularly concerned about urgency. Angel approached him during a lull in the work to show him what she had found and ask for his help in learning about the parasite. He did not take much convincing, as it was obvious he was curious about the tentacle himself, and he agreed to contact Angel when he had completed his dissection of it.

With that taken care of, Cosme returned the party to the reason they had come to the Septaspire: their expedition. Given the relative advantages of sea travel, Angel volunteered to ask Guinevere if she could convince her wife and crew to transport them around the continent to their destinations. However, it would have to wait until morning; even though it was only early evening, the day's excitement meant no one was in a mood to do much more than sleep. The party invited themselves to stay at Angel's house, the only accommodation that would allow all of them, and quickly settled down for the night: Frelia and Temperance in a Leomund's Tiny Hut in the living room, Kiel passed out in the first corner she could find, Pierre and Cosme in Angel's room, and Angel thinking to just find a quiet place to trance. 

Before they went to sleep a guilty Cosme - Pierre had mentioned he had a daughter in response to Angel explaining that she lived with her dads and would need to explain the party's presence in their house to them - reiterated her willingness to send Pierre home. She still sounded unhappy at the idea, particularly since that would leave her with no one who had actually answered the various calls for explorers she had put out but she was not intending to trap him on the continent if he wanted to go. Pierre was firm in his desire to stay for now but he did ask if she might send a message to his daughter. Cosme did so.

Rather late, Angel's parents returned home and Angel quickly explained what was going on. In other circumstances, they might have been angry about five strangers commandeering their house but it was clear from her demeanour that even Angel, who had done her best to keep a level head about what had happened, was distressed by the attack. As it was, they let her stay in their room for the night.

Once everyone was awake Angel and Pierre went out to take care of preparations for the voyage ahead. Pierre acquired spices, non-perishable ingredients, and some livestock that could easily be brought on the ship to make meals that were better than simple hardtack rations while Angel headed over to the house where Guinevere and Ophelia were staying.

Guinevere was just as concerned by Angel's story as her fathers had been but she was happy to help one of her oldest friends in a pinch. The Muros had no pressing engagements so she doubted Ophelia would have any objections. Ophelia, who knew Angel less well than her wife, seemed willing to be convinced and, after assessing Angel for herself, agreed to prepare her crew to depart from the city for noon. Angel brought the news back to the rest of the group, each of whom began to pack in earnest for the long trip ahead.
