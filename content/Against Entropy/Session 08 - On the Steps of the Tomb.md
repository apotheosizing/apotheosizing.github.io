# Session 8

Disembarkment day was characterized by a frisson of anticipatory energy in the air. While the party had what would be their last good meal for an indeterminate amount of time, Ophelia stopped by the galley to give Angel a means of contacting her to arrange passage back to the Septaspire - a pipe that had one use of the spell sending woven into it - and say that they hadn't been her most disruptive passengers. Vekhmed also had a brief conversation with Pierre, saying that he would happily lend aid to the party anywhere they might roam so long as he was asked. Angel and Kiel picked up on a strange undertone to this declaration that implied Pierre had likely had dealings with the fiend but they trusted his judgement enough to let the matter be.  
  
Setting foot on the Dead Continent was an unsettling experience. No birds flew overhead and not even the smallest insectoid life was present to fill the world with the hundred small, everyday sounds of life. This silence made the crunch of their footsteps on the sedimentary white material that made up the surface of the continent echo loudly, like the crunching of autumn's detritus under boots. Though it was masked by the salt of the coast, a coarse concrete dust scent hung in the air and followed the party as they headed north in search of the Tomb of Acererak.  
  
Angel's map, copied from the most recent land survey, suggested that it would be a week-long trek and without natural features to afford them shelter from the wind and sun it would be a hard march. Fortunately, food and water could be magically provided by Temperance and the approach of anythig dangerous would be obvious on the flat lands they travelled on so fatigue was their only great concern.  
  
As the sun gave way to the rising of the four moons, Kiel felt the mirror in her pocket grow warm and she fell back a short distance from her companions to speak to her friend. Her friend told her that there had been some difficulty in reaching her that suggested a misalignment of the place where Kiel was and where her friend dwelt, localised to this portion of the Dead Continent. Her friend was concerned that they may not be able to speak as easily as they usually did.  
  
Kiel asked if her friend had any advice for her in the event that they could not get in contact again. Her friend shrugged and said not to anger Acererak, which was self-evident. Her friend also indicated that there were only four other dreaming beings on the Continent, discounting Kiel's companions and the safe haven of the Septaspire. Kiel conveyed this information to her allies, though she did not divulge its source. The party accepted this at face value in spite of her odd behaviour, since it was valuable in its own right.  
  
After several days of setting uneventful watches in the night the party decided to switch to placing down an alarm spell around their campsite. This meant that, were they to be ambushed in the night, they would only be warned when the threat was already near, but the party concluded they were unlikely to be endangered by other creatures in this empty wasteland.  
  
It was jarring to see something on the horizon after six days of unbroken land and sky ahead of them but on the afternoon of what Angel forecasted would be their last day en route to the tomb the party saw the ruins of a structure in the distance. Broken columns and crumbling walls lay at the end of a slight incline, the artificial cliff face leading to a set of stone doors. More shocking than architecture of any kind were the appearance of other beings.  
  
At the top of the stairs, where the party approached the tomb, were three robed figures, and coming from the lowlands were a loosely-organized group of seirim led by two large humanoid-like creatures. In their minds the party were bade by the central robed figure to come aid her in defence of the tomb and, when they hesitated, more forcefully drawn into the conflict by a short-range teleport. Closer proximity revealed the skeletal face beneath the black robe and the amused red eye-lights of the lich Acererak, two skeletal servitors at her side.  
  
Acererak appraised the group and remarked that while they were not the champions she would choose for herself, they were sufficient. If they drove away the seirim she would reward them in kind. Seeing no other option, the party entered the fray.  
  
The seirimic horde was composed of numerous creatures of varying classification, all of which would be dangerous of any man to face alone. The fight with the lower tier seirim - their two "commanders" hung back and took potshots at the party as they cut through the infantry was brutal. Pierre was the victim of a nasty bite from a shoosuva that could easily have been deadly if not for Cosme and Temperance's healing magic and Frelia drew the ire of one of the giant commanders when it realized the effectiveness of the earth elemental she had summoned in keeping the heat off Kiel. She was struck in the head by two rocks, knocking her unconscious and breaking her concentration on the elemental's binding spell, unleashing a new rogue element onto the battlefield. Cosme again was able to avoid this being a fatality.  
  
Pierre, who had taken up a position near the both of them, noticed this surprising tactical moment from what appeared to be a seirim and realized that the two commanders were in fact infected with ichor, just as Charybdis and the lich had been. Unlike those two unfortunate souls, however, they had no magical power and thus could be kept under firmer control by the seirimic infection, thus giving the initial, false impression that they were non-sentient.  
  
Soon enough through sheer perseverance only the dregs of the army of seirim remained and the party turned their efforts to destroying the two commandersâ€¦
