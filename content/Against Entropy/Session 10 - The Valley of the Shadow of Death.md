# Session 10

Before they departed her tomb, Acererak appeared once more to ask a favour of Angel. She had a letter to be delivered to Wizard Bigby Rendar, care of the Septaspire. In exchange for the minor service the lich gave Angel a sealed letter with no addressee with the instruction to open it only in a moment of dire need. Angel saw no harm in taking the letter with her when she returned home, even if the sender was Acererak the Eternal, so she placed both letters in her pack as she finished breaking camp.

The final legs of their journey lay ahead and the party was eager to meet it. Frelia was much recovered from her ordeal so though still fatigued she insisted that she was able to travel unaided.

Acererak's tomb marked a subtle change in the wasteland around them. There were still no animals, no flowing water, and no sign of humanoid habitation but the land itself was no longer perfectly flat. Only when their path had sunk into the earth by a half a metre did the party realize that they were walking into a valley. Whether it was the remnants of a river that had once carved through the Continent or the shifting of the earth as its subcutaneous plates jockeyed for position they could not say.

For the first time in several days their field of view was narrowed down to their immediate surroundings so it was not surprising that all of the adventurers picked up on a change in atmospheric temperature and a hint of fog that permeated the stone. Its white, cracked stone seemed to seep with moisture rather that having split from the relentless dry. Kiel used her ability to commune with nature to get a better idea of the topology. She sensed the last foundations of buildings that had once stood overlooking the valley. These ruins were days of travel out from the epicenter of the event that had destroyed the Black City and still they had been laid to waste. Frelia hoped that whatever had caused such massive devastation was no longer there when they arrived.

Feeling discomfitted Kiel took the lead in preparation for trouble. Her instincts proved correct when she spotted figures in the mist. These were the unquiet dead, the last serfs of Annar Vult, mere bones animated by ectoplasmic spirits. Not only did these wraiths seek their deaths but he mist itself was a malevolent force that struck out at the party with harsh winds and searing cold.

Angel and Pierre were rendered incapacitated by the creature of the fog, effectively reducing the party's fighting force to four. Frelia attempted to bolster the shortfall with a summoned elemental but she released it prematurely when another idea occured to her. The mist around them could not escape the cloud of daggers spell so, if she could hold her concentration on it, it was only a matter of time before the fog broke. Temperance had a similar idea and wielded the guardian spirits of their god against their assembled foes to potent results.

Nevertheless, when someone called from the other end of the valley to offer their aid, the party welcomed it. Three strangers who must be the adventurers Acererak had seen near the city lent their strength to the fight and ensured that the last of the undead were dispatched without heavy casualties.

While Temperance began the work of healing the party the leader of the other group, a dragonborn man called Ciar introduced himself and his companions, Bruno and Nyiko. He was pleasant and jovial with the party, answering the questions put to him. He and his group were investigating rumours of the return of the White Company on behalf of an unnamed third-party. Their route had taken them along a different path up to the point of the valley which served as a chokepoint for entry to Annar Vult. Given the poor health and low spirits of the party Ciar suggested they take a breather and trade what information they had gleaned. Seeing no reason to object, the party settled down for a short rest.
