# Session 7

The statue requested that the party confirm its understanding of the date and, when it was satisfied that its internal mechanisms were accurate, made to depart. The party quickly intervened, seeking an explanation of the situation. In general, it was candid, though there were a few questions it refused to answer. The statue gave its name as The inexorable procession of time as seen in the devouring of iron by rust - or simply Rust. It had been flung into the mare by a teleportation circle misfire two thousand years hence and found itself unable to leave until the *Muros* dredged it up. As for what it was, Rust said that it was formed from a small portion of the universal principle of time - the very phenomenon that formed its name - by a powerful being known as the Witch-Queen of Perrenland.

No one in the party was familiar with Perrenland or its queen but, on this point at least, they had no reason to doubt its explanation that Perrenland was one of the realms of the fae. It further explained that it was capable of manipulating the flow of time to a limited degree, though - in response to Pierre asking if it might help them avoid the many deaths caused by Charybdis' attack - it cautioned against interference with deaths or births. The gods misliked mortals meddling with the lives that were rightfully theirs.

With all their questions answered, Rust crossed to the other side of the deck. Being presented with more water, it requested that it remain aboard until the ship made landfall. The party agreed.

Over the next two weeks of travel, the *Muros*' course turned southwestward toward the nadir of the Dead Continent. During this time, the party took advantage of the wide array of skilled individuals aboard the *Muros* to begin tutelage in new skills. Angel learned the basics of good practices regarding primary historical sources with Frelia, Pierre was taught the grammatical foundation of the goblin tongue by Cosme, and Temperance was given practical instruction by Vekhmed (who uncharacteristically waived the usual fee for their services) in herbalism.

Outside these hours of work, Angel, whose scant free time was still absorbed with the work of navigation, received a sending from the First Druid. He had completed his examination of the sample of the material Angel had gathered from the lich who attacked the Septaspire and concluded that it was seirimic ichor, which had been changed from its base liquid form to a semi-solid by various environmental factors. Angel asked for further clarification and Lingenhall condescended to explain that seirim was the proper name for what laypeople called demons. Ichor was commonly thought of as their blood but it would be more accurate to say it was their base material, as flesh was for mortals.

Contrary to popular conception, seirim were non-sentient creatures that worked more like an infection on the body than thinking creatures on the world. While Lingenhall seemed to find this merely a point of intellectual curiosity, when Angel shared the news with her companions both Frelia and Temperance were concerned. Of course, seirim had made contact with this plane aeons ago and their influence could never be fully expunged, this represented greater, renewed activity specific to the Dead Continent.

A handful of days later, Jim and Toe excitedly woke the party to inform them that land had been spotted on the horizon. Assuming fair weather and currents, the *Muros* would reach its destination in two days. The party went above deck to catch their first sight of the terrain they would be contending with for the foreseeable future.

The southern Dead Continent, untouched by the terraforming efforts of the spellcasters of the Septaspire, was unnaturally flat, as if a great hand had pressed it into shape. Its surface was a bone-white, cracked expanse of sheer nothingness that would yield little in the way of shelter for the travellers. Though their journey by sea had been long, it seemed greater trials were still to come.

That night, once the general excitement had worn off, the sense of an impending end to things came over the crew, and particularly the two boys Kiel had grown close with. They told her, if not in so many words, that they would miss her and asked when she would be coming back. Kiel could not answer them, as much about the journey was uncertain, but she assured them that they would see her again.

As the boys tucked into bed in the sleeping bags they had moved near her cot, Kiel excused herself to experience her emotions in private. While away, she received an indication that her friend in the mirror wanted to speak to her. Her friend bore a message: Rust was deceiving them all. It was not necessarily a dangerous deception or hiding any harmful intent, but it was keeping the truth from them.

Kiel took this warning to heart and decided to speak to Pierre so that the two of them could talk with Rust together. It was, as it had been since the day of its appearance, standing still in the crew quarters, its face displaying the time. She and Pierre asked Rust a few further questions, under the principle that it might contradict itself if required to elaborate on its story. Although it uttered no obvious falsehoods, they learned a number of interesting things.

It refused to give up any inkling of its plans now that it was free but, in response to learning of their plans, it indicated that the Witch-Queen of Perrenland was an old rival of Acererak, though it had no personal enmity with her. It also claimed that much of what it was unwilling to tell them, like the place where it had been created on the material plane or what it had been doing before its teleportation error, was for their protection - possessing that knowledge would put them in danger from some nebulous force.

Eventually, when they could learn no more from Rust, the two admitted defeat for the time being and took the time to ruminate on what they'd been told. Pierre wondered most of all at its motive for keeping its secret and, though he could not make a conclusive judgement, he noted that it only ever referred to the importance of two beings: itself and its creator.
