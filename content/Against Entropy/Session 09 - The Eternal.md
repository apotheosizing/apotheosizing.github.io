# Session 09

Now that the chaff of their force had been winnowed away the two infected colossi strode into the fray. One of the giants joined the last of the barlgura and the shoosuva to attack Pierre, Cosme, and Frelia to the south while the other lay in wait under the protective shell of a wall of stone. On the north half of the battlefield the most potent threat was Frelia's unbound water elemental which indiscriminately attacked both Temperance and Kiel and the nearby bulezau.

In all the chaos, Frelia was struck by the giant. In her weakened state she was unable to defend herself as she had against the barlgura and she fell dead. Several members of the party knew the revivify spell but they had no diamonds to power the casting, and besides could not spare the time under the seirim's relentless assault.

Through luck and skill the party was able to destroy the seirim, with Kiel driving her blade through the heart of the giant who had slain Frelia. As the news of what had happened spread to the rest of the companions Acererak drew near to acknowledge their adequate defence of her tomb. Kiel whirled on the archlich - first and only of the great Vecna's apprentices, destroyer of gods and kingdoms of eld, a being who had outwitted Death - and demanded that she restore Frelia to life. Acererak dithered, not particularly interested in helping them, but she relented when it was pointed out to her that they had done for her a "trivial" service in driving away the seirim; for her, reviving Frelia should be equally simple.

Without need of a word, Acererak returned Frelia's soul to its rightful place. Her death wound was healed by the same spell but it was clear that Frelia would require time to recover from the impact trauma she had taken. Since all debts between them were resolved Acererak asked the party why they had come to this place.

The party carefully divulged only their interest in Annar Vult, which did not surprise Acererak given that it was the only notable landmark to be found on the wasteland of the Dead Continent. She called it the Black City when she spoke of it and Kiel pointed out that it was ironic that the White Company was tied to such a place. Acererak said that this was no coincidence: the leader of the White Company had named it in antithesis to the city in order to foment the malcontent that destroyed it. Acererak attributed her motives to simple jealousy that she was not in power rather than any altruism but her testimony was suspect at best.

More relevant to the moment, Acererak mentioned offhandedly that she had seen a trio of people in the vicinity of the ruins. The party suspected that it was this group that had spawned the rumours of the Company's return that they had been chasing and expressed interest in meeting these individuals.

They also ventured to ask Acererak about the seirim they had encountered, as she seemed familiar with the creatures. Her speculation aligned with First Druid Lingenhall's that by chance or by conscious effort from an unknown actor a spore of seirimic infection had reached this plane and taken root here on the Dead Continent. There was likely no immediate danger to the party as it would take many years for the world to be consumed but according to Acererak no world escaped the Abyss' grasp forever.

Indeed the party's most immediate concern was recovering from the battle. Acererak drifted off on her own business, leaving the party to the matter of logistics. Frelia was in no shape for prolonged travel and the rest of the group were battered, bruised, and exhausted. The obvious shelter was the Tomb of Acererak but naturally the party felt some hesitation to enter it. Cosme, however, pushed past their trepidation and headed toward the door, since they were vanishingly unlikely to find a better option.

The door of the tomb was not locked. Within they found stale air and clean, dilapidated rooms filled with treasure so old that its value was lost. The party made camp in the main hallway, whiling away the hours until evening in companionable rest. Temperance advised the others not to let Frelia sleep, as many people who suffer head injuries do not awaken. Angel had the advantage of not needing to sleep so she volunteered for the task of keeping the groggy Frelia from falling unconscious. The two played some simple games and Frelia made an attempt at reading but she was too disoriented to focus on much of anything.

In the night, Angel had a brief conversation with Acererak, who had entered the tomb somehow without the use of its only door. She thanked the lich for allowing them to stay and Acererak reminded her not to take indifference for kindness. Still, nothing troubled them that night and the party woke refreshed and ready to make the rest of the journey to Annar Vult.
